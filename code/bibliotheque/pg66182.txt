BACON'S ESSAYS, BY MARKBY.

Mr. Markby has recently published his promised edition of Bacon's
_Essays_; and he has in this, as in his edition of the _Advancement of
Learning_, successfully traced most of the passages alluded to by Lord
Bacon. The following notes relate to a few points which still deserve
attention:

Essay I. On Truth:--"The poet that beautified the sect that was otherwise
inferior to the rest."] By "beautified" is here meant "set off to
advantage," "embellished."

Essay II. On Death.--

Many of the thoughts in the _Essays_ recur in the "Exempla Antithetorum,"
in the 6th book _De Augmentis Scientiarum_. With respect to this Essay,
compare the article "Vita," No. 12., in vol. viii. p. 360. ed. Montagu.

"You shall read in some of the friars' books of mortification, that a man
should think with himself what the pain is, if he have but his finger's
end pressed or tortured, and thereby imagine what the pains of death are
when the whole body is corrupted and dissolved."] Query, What books are
here alluded to?

"Pompa mortis magis terret, quam mors ipsa."] Mr. Markby thinks these
words are an allusion to Sen. _Ep._ xxiv. § 13. Something similar also
occurs in _Ep._ xiv. § 3. Compare Ovid, _Heroid._ x. 82.: "Morsque minus
pœnæ quam mora mortis habet."

"Galba, with a sentence, 'Feri si ex re sit populi Romani.'"] In addition
to the passage of Tacitus, quoted by Mr. Markby, see Sueton. _Galb._ c.
20.

"Septimus Severus in despatch, 'Adeste si quid mihi restat agendum.'"] No
such dying words are attributed to Severus, either in Dio Cassius, lxxvi.
15., the passage cited by Mr. Markby, or in Spartian. _Sever._ c. 23.

In the passage of Juvenal, the words are, "qui spatium vitæ," and not
"qui finem vitæ," as quoted by Lord Bacon. Length of life is meant.

Essay III. Of Unity in Religion.--

"Certain Laodiceans and lukewarm persons."] The allusion is to Rev. iii.
14-16.

{142}

"It is noted by one of the Fathers, Christ's coat indeed had no seam, but
the Church's vesture was of divers colours; whereupon he saith, 'in veste
varietas sit, scissura non sit.'"] Query, Who is the Father alluded to?

"The massacre in France."] _I. e._ the massacre of St. Bartholomew.

Essay IV. Of Revenge.--See _Antitheta_, No. 39. vol. viii. p. 374.

The saying of Cosmo, Duke of Florence, as to not forgiving friends,
recurs in the _Apophthegms_, vol. i. p. 394. ed. Montagu.

Essay V. Of Adversity.--

On the fable of Hercules sailing over the ocean in an earthen pot,
see _Sap. Vet._, vol. x. p. 335. And concerning the Greek fable, see
Schneidewin, _Del. Poes._ Gr., p. 329.

Essay VI. Of Simulation and Dissimulation.--See _Antitheta_, No. 32. vol.
viii. p. 370.

"Arts of state and arts of life, as Tacitus well calleth them."] Mr.
Markby does not trace this allusion, which is not obvious.

Essay VII. Of Parents and Children.--See _Antitheta_, No. 5. vol. viii.
p. 356.

"The Italians make little difference between children and nephews, or
near kinsfolk."] Query, What ground is there for this assertion?

"Generally the precept is good: 'Optimum elige, suave et facile illud
faciet consuetudo.'"] Query, Who is the author of this precept?

Essay VIII. Of Marriage and Single Life.--See _Antitheta_, No. 5. vol.
viii. p. 356.

The answer of Thales concerning marriage is also given in Plut. _Symp._
iii. 3.

Essay IX. Of Envy.--See _Antitheta_, No. 16. vol. viii. p. 362.

"The Scripture calleth envy an evil eye."] Lord Bacon appears to allude
to James iv. 5.: "Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain, the
Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?"

"Non est curiosus, quin idem sit malevolus."] From Plautus, _Stich._ 1.
3. v. 55. "Nam curiosus nemo est, quin sit malevolus."

"Therefore it was well said, 'Invidia festos dies non agit.'"] Whence is
this saying taken? It occurs likewise in the _Antitheta_.

Essay X. Of Love.--See _Antitheta_, No. 36. vol. viii. p. 373.

"It hath been well said, that the arch-flatterer, with whom all the petty
flatterers have intelligence, is a man's self."] Query, From whom is this
saying quoted?

"It was well said, that it is impossible to love and to be wise."]
Mr. Markby cites a verse of Publius Syrus, "Amare et sapere vix Deo
conceditur." Compare Menander, _Andria_, Fragm. 1., and Ovid, _Met._ ii.
846.: "Non bene conveniunt, nec in unâ sede morantur, Majestas et amor."

"I know not how, but martial men are given to love."] Aristotle (_Pol._
ii. 9.) has the same remark, adding that there was good reason for the
fable which made Venus the spouse of Mars.

Essay XI. Of Great Place.--See _Antitheta_, No. 7. vol. viii. p. 357.

"Cum non sis qui fueris, non esse cur velis vivere."] Whatever may be the
source of this quotation, the sense seems to require _est_ for _esse_.

"It is most true that was anciently spoken: 'A place showeth the man.'"]
The allusion is to the celebrated Greek proverb "ἀρχὴ ἄνδρα δείκνυσι,"
attributed to Bias, Solon, Pittacus, and others. See Diogenianus, _Prov._
ii. 94., with the note of Leutsch and Schneidewin.

Essay XII. Of Boldness.--See _Antitheta_, No. 33. vol. viii. p. 371.

"Question was asked of Demosthenes," &c.] See _Cic. de Orat._ iii. 56.;
_Brut._ 38.; _Plut. Vit. X. Orat._ c. 8. By the Greek word ὑπόκρισις, and
the Latin word _actio_, in this anecdote, is meant all that belongs to
the _acting_ or _delivery_ of a speech. Bacon appears, by his following
remarks, not to include elocution in _actio_; which was certainly not
Cicero's understanding of the word.

"If the hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet will go to the hill."]
Query, What is the authority for this well-known story?

Essay XIII. Of Goodness.--

"The Turks, a cruel people, nevertheless are kind to beasts, and give
alms to dogs and birds; insomuch, as Busbechius reporteth, a Christian
boy in Constantinople had like to have been stoned for gagging in a
waggishness a long-billed fowl."] A. G. Busbequius, _Legationis Turcicæ
Epistolæ quattuor_, in Epist. iii. p. 107. of his works, Lond. 1660,
tells a story of a Venetian goldsmith at Constantinople, who was fond
of fowling, and had caught a bird of the size of the cuckoo, and of the
same colour; with a beak not very large, but with jaws so wide that,
when opened, they would admit a man's fist. This bird he fastened over
his door, with extended wings, and a stick in his beak, so as to extend
the jaws to a great width, as a joke. The Turks, who were passing by,
took compassion on the bird; seized the goldsmith by the neck, and led
him before the criminal judge. He was with difficulty saved from an
infliction of the bastinado by the interference of the Venetian Bailo.
The man told the story to Busbequius, and showed him the bird; who
supposed it to be the _Caprimulgus_, or goat-sucker. A full account of
the _Caprimulgus Europæus_ (the bird here alluded to) may be seen in
the _Penny Cyclopædia_, art. NIGHTJARS. It will be observed that Bacon
quotes the story from memory, and does not represent the particulars of
it with accuracy. It is not a Christian _boy_, nor is he threatened with
_stoning_, nor is the bird a _long-billed_ fowl.

{143}

"Neither give thou Æsop's cock a gem," &c.] Compare _Apophthegms_, No.
203. p. 393.

"Such men in other men's calamities are, as it were, in season, _and are
ever on the loading part_."] By "the loading part," seems to be meant
the part which is most heavily laden; the part which supports the chief
burthen.

"Misanthropi, that make it their practice to bring men to the bough, and
yet have never a tree for the purpose in their gardens as Timon had."]
Query, What is the allusion in this passage? Nothing of the sort occurs
in Lucian's dialogue of Timon.

Essay XIV. Of Nobility.--See _Antitheta_, No. 1. vol. viii. p. 354.

Essay XV. Of Seditions and Troubles.--

"As Machiavel noteth well, when princes, that ought to be common parents,
make themselves as a party," &c.] Perhaps Lord Bacon alludes to _Disc._
iii. 27.

"As Tacitus expresseth it well, 'Liberius quam ut imperantium
meminissent.'"] Mr. Markby is at a loss to trace this quotation. I am
unable to assist him.

The verses of Lucan are quoted from memory. The original has, "Avidumque
in tempora," and "Et concussa fides."

"Dolendi modus, timendi non item."] Query, Whence are these words taken?

"Solvam cingula regum."] Mr. Markby refers to Job xii. 18.; but the
passage alluded to seems to be Isaiah xlv. 1.

The story of Epimetheus is differently applied in _Sap. Vet._, vol. x. p.
342.

The saying of Cæsar on Sylla is inserted in the _Apophthegms_, No. 135.
p. 379. That of Galba is likewise to be found in Suet. _Galb._ 16.

Essay XVI. Of Atheism.--See _Antitheta_, No. 13. vol. viii. p. 360.

"Who to him is instead of a god, or melior natura."] From Ovid, _Met._ 1.
21. "Hanc deus et melior litem natura diremit."

Essay XVII. Of Superstition.--See _Antitheta_, No. 13. vol. viii. p. 360.

Essay XIX. Of Empire.--See _Antitheta_, No. 8. vol. viii. p. 358.

"And the like was done by that league, which Guicciardini saith was the
security of Italy," &c.] The league alluded to, is that of 1485. See
Guicciardini, lib. i. c. 1.

"Neither is the opinion of some of the school-men to be received, that a
war cannot justly be made but upon a precedent injury or provocation."]
Grotius lays down the same doctrine as Bacon, _De J. B. et P._, ii. 1. §§
2, 3. Query, What school-men are here referred to?

Essay XX. Of Counsel.--See _Antitheta_, No. 44. vol. viii. p. 377.

Jupiter and Metis.] See _Sap. Vet._, vol. xi. p. 354.

"For which inconveniences, the doctrine of Italy, and practice of France,
in some kings' times, hath introduced cabinet councils: a remedy worse
than the disease." By "cabinet councils" are here meant private meetings
of selected advisers in the king's own apartment.

"Principis est virtus maxima nosse suos."] From Martial, viii. 15.

"It was truly said, '_Optimi consiliarii mortui._'"] Compare
_Apophthegms_, No. 105.: "Alonzo of Arragon was wont to say of himself,
that he was a great necromancer; for that he used to ask counsel of the
dead, meaning books."

Essay XXI. Of Delays.--See _Antitheta_, No. 41. vol. viii. p. 376.

"Occasion (as it is in the common verse) turneth a bald noddle," &c.] See
"N. & Q.," Vol. iii., pp. 8. 43., where this saying is illustrated.

Essay XXII. Of Cunning.--

"The old rule, to know a fool from a wise man: 'Mitte ambos nudos ad
ignotos, et videbis.'"] Attributed to "one of the philosophers" in
_Apophthegms_, No. 255. p. 404.

"I knew a counsellor and secretary that never came to Queen Elizabeth of
England with bills to sign, but he would always first put her into some
discourse of estate, that she might the less mind the bills."] King's
or queen's bills is a technical expression for a class of documents
requiring the royal signature, which is still, or was recently, in use.
See Murray's _Official Handbook_, by Mr. Redgrave, p. 257. Query, To
which of Queen Elizabeth's Secretaries of State does Bacon allude? And
again, who are meant by the "two who were competitors for the Secretary's
place in Queen Elizabeth's time," mentioned lower down?

Essay XXIII. Of Wisdom for a Man's Self.--

"It is the wisdom of rats, that will be sure to leave a house somewhat
before it fall."] Query, How and when did this popular notion (now
engrafted upon our political language) originate?

"It is the wisdom of crocodiles, that shed tears when they would
devour."] This saying seems to be derived from the belief, that the
crocodile imitates the cry of children in order to attract their mothers,
and then to devour them. See Salgues, _Des Erreurs et des Préjugés_, tom.
ii. p. 406.

Essay XXIV. Of Innovations.--See _Antitheta_, No. 40. vol. viii. p. 375.

Essay XXV. Of Despatch.--See _Antitheta_, No. 27. vol. viii. p. 368.

"I knew a wise man, that had it for a by-word, when he saw men hasten to
a conclusion, 'Stay a little, that we may make an end the sooner.'"] Mr.
Markby says that Sir Amias Paulet is the {144} person alluded to. The
saying in _Apophthegms_, No. 14. p. 414.

"The Spartans and Spaniards have been noted to be of small despatch: 'Mi
venga la muerte de Spagna,--Let my death come from Spain, for then it
will be sure to be long in coming.'"] The slow and dilatory character of
the Lacedæmonians is noted in Thucyd. i. 70.: "Καὶ μὴν καὶ ἄοκνοι πρὸς
ὑμᾶς μελλητάς." And again, i. 84.: "Καὶ τὸ βραδὺ καὶ μέλλον, ὃ μέμφονται
μάλιστα ἡμῶν." Livy represents the Rhodians making a similar remark to
the Roman senate in 167 B.C.: "Atheniensium populum fama est celerem et
supra vires audacem esse ad conandum: Lacedæmoniorum cunctatorem, et vix
in ea, quibus fidit, ingredientem," xlv. 23. Bayle, in his _Pensées sur
les Comètes_, § 243., has a passage which illustrates the slowness of the
Spaniards:--"D'un côté on prévoyoit, que l'empereur et le roi d'Espagne
se serviroient de très grandes forces, pour opprimer la chrétienté:
mais on prévoyoit aussi de l'autre, qu'ils ne seroient jamais en état
de l'accabler, parceque la lenteur et les longues délibérations qui
ont toujours fait leur partage, font perdre trop de bonnes occasions.
Vous savez la pensée de Malherbe sur ce sujet: S'il est vrai, dit-il
dans quelqu'une de ses lettres, que l'Espagne aspire à la monarchie
universelle, je lui conseille de demander à Dieu une surséance de la fin
du monde."

Essay XXVI. Of seeming wise.--

"Magno conatu nugas."] From Terence, _Heaut._ iii. _5._ 8.: "Ne ista,
hercle, magno jam conatu magnas nugas dixerit."

Essay XXVII. Of Friendship.--

"Epimenides the Candian."] Bacon calls the ancient Cretan priest
Epimenides a "Candian," as Machiavel speaks of the capture of Rome by
the "Francesi" under Brennus. Mr. Pashley, in his _Travels in Crete_,
vol. i. p. 189., shows that Candia is a name unknown in the island; and
that among the natives its ancient denomination is still in use. The name
Candia has been propagated over Europe from the Italian usage.

"The Latin adage meeteth with it a little: 'Magna civitas, magna
solitudo.'"] See Erasm. _Adag._, p. 1293. It is taken from a verse of a
Greek comic poet, which referred to the city of Megalopolis in Arcadia:
"Ἐρημία μεγάλη 'στὶν ἡ Μεγάλη πόλις."--Strab. viii. 8. § 1.

"The Roman name attaineth the true use and cause thereof, naming them
'participes curarum.'"] To what examples of this expression does Bacon
refer?

"The parable of Pythagoras is dark, but true: 'Cor ne edito.'"]
Concerning this Pythagorean precept, see Diog., Laert. viii. 17, 18., cum
not.

The saying of Themistocles is repeated in _Apophthegms_, No. 199. p. 392.

The saying of Heraclitus is repeated, _Apophthegms_, No. 268.; _De
Sap. Vet._, vol. xi. p. 346. It is alluded to in _Nov. Org._, ii. 32.:
"Quicquid enim abducit intellectum a consuetis, æquat et complanat aream
ejus, ad recipiendum _lumen siccum et purum_ notionum verarum."

"It was a sparing speech of the ancients, to say that a friend is another
himself."] See Aristot., _Mag. Mor._ ii. 11.: "Μία φανὲν ψυχὴ ἡ ἐμὴ καὶ
ἡ τούτου;" and again, c. 15.: "Τοιοῦτος οἷος ἕτερος εἶναι ἐγὼ, ἀν γε καὶ
σφόδρα φίλον τοιήσῃς, ὥσπερ τὸ λεγόμενον 'ἄλλος οὗτος Ἡρακλῆς,' 'ἄλλος
φίλος ἐγώ.'" _Eth. Eud._ vii. 12.: "Ὁ γὰρ φίλος βούλεται εἶναι, ὥσπερ ἡ
παροιμία φησὶν, ἄλλος Ἠρακλῆς, ἄλλος οὗτος."

THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA.

The interest which the execution of the railroad across the Isthmus of
Panama excites, induces me to transmit you the following extract from
Gage's _New Survey of the West Indies_, 8vo., London, 1699.

A few lines relative to the author, of whom but little is known, may be
also of use. He was the son of John Gage, of Haling; and his brother
was Sir Henry Gage, governor of Oxford, killed at the battle at Culham
Bridge, Jan. 11, 1644. His family were of the Roman Catholic faith; and
he was sent by his father in 1612 into Spain, to study under the Jesuits,
in the hope he would join that society; but his aversion to them led him
to enter the Dominican Order at Valladolid, in 1612. His motives were
suspected; his father was irritated--threatened to disinherit him and to
arouse against him the power of the Jesuits of England if he returned
home. He now determined to pass over to the Spanish possessions in South
America; but as an order had been issued by the king, forbidding this to
any _Englishman_, it was only by inclosing him in an empty sea-biscuit
case, he was able to sail from Cadiz, July 2, 1625. He arrived at
Mexico on October 8; and after residing there for some time to recruit
himself from the voyage, resolved to abandon a missionary scheme to the
Philippine islands he had planned, and accordingly, on the day fixed for
their departure to Acapulco, escaped with three other Dominicans for
Chispat. He was here well received, and went subsequently to the head
establishment at Guatimala. He was soon appointed curate of Amatitlan;
and during his residence at this and another district contrived to amass
a sum of 9000 piastres, with the aid of which he sought to accomplish
his long-cherished desire of returning to England. Many difficulties
were in his way; but on the 7th January, 1637, he quitted Amatitlan,
traversed the province of Nicaragua, and embarked from the coast of
Costa Rica. The ship was soon after boarded by a Dutch corsair, and Gage
was robbed of 8000 piastres. He succeeded in reaching Panama, traversed
the Isthmus, and sailed from Porto Bello {145} in the Spanish fleet,
which reached San Sucar, Nov. 28, 1637. He returned to England after
an absence of twenty-four years. His father was dead: he found himself
disinherited, and although hardly recognised by his family at first, he
met ultimately with kindly treatment. During his residence in S. America,
doubts had arisen in his mind as to the truth and validity of the creed
and ritual to which he was attached. Whether this was the consequence
of reflection from his theological studies, or animated love of change
which his conduct at times betrayed, cannot be decided. He resolved to
proceed to Italy, and renew his studies there. Upon his return, after a
short residence, he renounced Catholicism in a sermon he preached at St.
Paul's. About 1642 he attached himself to the Parliament cause, and it
is said he obtained the living of Deal in Kent; as the parish registers
contain an entry of the burial of Mary daughter, and Mary wife, of
Thomas Gage, parson of Deal, March 21, 1652; but when he was married,
and whom he married, does not appear. Gage's work has been rather too
much decried. It contains matter of interest relative to the state of
the Spanish possessions; and his credulity and superstition must be
considered in relation to his opportunities and his age. Perhaps some
of your readers may contribute farther information concerning him, as
the general accounts I have been able to meet with are contradictory
and insufficient. The _Biographie Universelle_ states, that it was his
_Survey of the West Indies_ that led to the English expeditions to the
Spanish Main, which secured Jamaica to the English in 1654, and adds he
died there in 1655. The registers at Deal could probably prove this fact;
but I confess to doubt as to whether Gage really were the parson alluded
to as resident there in 1652. He was evidently of a roving unsteady
nature, fond of adventure, and the first to open to English enterprise
a knowledge of the state of the Spanish possessions, to prevent which
the council of the Indies had passed so many stringent laws. Colbert
caused this work to be translated, and it has been often reprinted on the
Continent, but much mutilated, as his statements relative to the Roman
Catholic priesthood gave offence. A good memoir of Gage is still to be
desired. The following is the extract relative to the Isthmus of Panama,
_West Indies_, p. 151.:--

    "The Peruvian part containeth all the southern tract, and
    is tyed to the Mexican by the Isthmus or Strait of Darien,
    being no more than 17, or, as others say, in the narrowest
    place, but 12 miles broad, from the north to the south sea.
    Many have mentioned to the Council of Spain the cutting of a
    navigable channel through this small Isthmus, so to shorten
    the voyage to China and the Moluccoes. But the kings of Spain
    have not yet attempted to do it; some say lest in the work he
    should lose those few Indians which are left (would to God it
    were so, that they were or had been so careful and tender of
    the poor Indians' lives, more populous would that vast and
    spacious country be at this day), but others say he hath not
    attempted it lest the passage by the Cape Bona Esperanza (Good
    Hope) being left off, those seas might become a receptacle
    for pirates. However, this hath not been attempted by the
    Spaniards; they give not for reason any extraordinary great
    charge, for that would soon be recompensed with the speedie and
    easie conveying that way the commodities from S. to N. seas."

This bears reference to projects before 1625, or during his residence in
S. America, between 1625-1637; but Gage could hardly have understood the
nature of the Spanish character, and the genius of the government, to
speculate upon the cause of their neglect of every useful enterprise for
the promotion of commerce and public good.

FOLK LORE.

_Legends of the County Clare._--On the west coast of Ireland, near the
Cliffs of Moher, at some distance out in the bay, the waves appear
continually breaking in white foam even on the calmest day. The tradition
among the country people is, that a great city was swallowed up there for
some great crime, and that it becomes visible once every seven years.
And if the person who sees it could keep his eyes fixed on it till he
reached it, it would then be restored, and he would obtain great wealth.
The man who related the legend stated farther, that some years ago some
labourers were at work in a field on the hill side in view of the bay;
and one of them, happening to cast his eyes seaward, saw the city in all
its splendour emerge from the deep. He called to his companions to look
at it; but though they were close to him, he could not attract their
attention: at last, he turned round to see why they would not come; but
on looking back, when he had succeeded in attracting their attention, the
city had disappeared.

The Welsh legend of the Islands of the Blessed, which can only be seen
by a person who stands on a turf from St. David's churchyard, bears a
curious coincidence to the above. It is not impossible that there may
have been some foundation for the vision of the enchanted city at Moher
in the _Fata Morgana_, very beautiful spectacles of which have been seen
on other parts of the coast of Ireland.

_Moon Superstitions_ (Vol. viii., p. 79.).--In this age of fact and
science, it is remarkable that even with the well-informed the old faith
in the "change of the moon" as a prognostic of fair and foul weather
still keeps its hold. W. W. asks "have we any proof of" the "correctness"
of this faith? To suppose that the weather varies with the amount of
{146} illuminated surface on the moon would make the change in the
weather vary with the amount of moonshine, which of course is absurd,
as in that case the clouds would have much more to do with the question
than the moon's shadow. But still it may be said the moon may influence
the weather as it is supposed to cause the tides. In answer to this I
beg to state the opinion of Dr. Ick, who was for upwards of ten years
the curator of the Birmingham Philosophical Institute, an excellent
meteorologist, geologist, and botanist. He assured me that after the
closest and most accurate observation of the moon and the weather, he had
arrived at the conclusion that _there is not the slightest observable
dependence between them_.

a female is afflicted with fits, nine pieces of silver money and nine
threehalfpences are collected from nine bachelors: the silver money
is converted into a ring to be worn by the afflicted person, and the
threehalfpences (_i. e._ 13½_d._) are paid to the maker of the ring,
an inadequate remuneration for his labour, but which he good-naturedly
accepts. If the afflicted person be a male, the contributions are levied
upon females.

it must die. Hence the custom, so universal, of hanging any serpent on a

_A Devonshire Charm for the Thrush._--On visiting one of my parishioners,

the eighth Psalm over it. I found that her cure was to repeat the
eighth Psalm over the infant three times, three days running; and on my
hesitating a doubt as to the efficacy of the remedy, she appealed to the
case of another of her children who had suffered badly from the thrush,
but had been cured by the use of no other means. If it was said "with
the virtue," it was, she declared, an unfailing cure. The mention, in
this Psalm, of "the mouths of babes and sucklings," I suppose led to its
selection.

OLD JOKES.

Every man ought to read the jest-books, that he may not make himself
disagreeable by repeating "old Joes" as the very last good things.
One book of this class is little more than the copy of another as to
the points, with a change of the persons; and the same joke, slightly
varied, appears in as many different countries as the same fairy-tale.
Seven years ago I found at Prague the "Joe" of the Irishman saying that
there were a hundred judges on the bench, because there was one with two
cyphers. The valet-de-place told me that when the Emperor and Metternich
were together they were called "the council of ten," because they were
_eins und zero_.

It is interesting to trace a joke back, of which process I send an
example. In the very clever version of the Chancellor of Oxford's speech
on introducing the new doctors (_Punch_, No. 622.) are these lines:

    "En Henleium! en Stanleium! Hic eminens prosator:
    Ille, filius pulchro patre, hercle pulchrior orator;
    Demosthenes in herbâ, _sed in ore retinens illos_
    _Quos, antequam peroravit, Græcus respuit lapillos._"

Ebenezer Grubb, in his description of the opposition in 1814, thus
notices Mr. F. Douglas:

    "He is a forward and frequent speaker; remarkable for a
    graceful inclination of the upper part of his body in advance
    of the lower, and speaketh, I suspect _(after the manner of an
    ancient), with pebbles in his mouth_."--_New Whig Guide_, 1819,
    p. 47.

In Foote's _Patron_, Sir Roger Dowlas, an East India proprietor, who has
sought instruction in oratory from Sir Thomas Lofty, is introduced to the
_conversazione_:--

    "_Sir Thomas._ Sir Roger, be seated. This gentleman has, in
    common with the greatest orator the world ever saw, a small
    natural infirmity; he stutters a little: but I have prescribed
    the same remedy that Demosthenes used, and don't despair of a
    radical cure. Well, sir, have you digested those general rules?

    _Sir Roger._ Pr-ett-y well, I am obli-g'd to you, Sir Th-omas.

    _Sir Thomas._ Did you open at the last general court?

    _Sir Roger._ I att-empt-ed fo-ur or five times.

    _Sir Thomas._ What hindered your progress?

    _Sir Roger._ _The pe-b-bles._

    {147}

    _Sir Thomas._ _Oh, the pebbles in his mouth_: but they are only
    put in to practise in private: _you should take them out when
    you are addressing the public_."

I cannot trace the joke farther, but as Foote, though so rich in wit, was
a great borrower, it might not be new in 1764.

AN INTERPOLATION OF THE PLAYERS: TOBACCO.

I have witnessed the representation of the _Twelfth Night_ as often,
during the last five-and-forty years, as I have had an opportunity;
and, in every instance, Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and the Clown, in their
rollicking orgies, _smoke tobacco_. Now, this must be an "interpolation
of the players;" for not only was tobacco unknown in Illyria, at the
period of the story, but _Shakspeare does not once name tobacco in his
works, and, therefore_, was not likely to give a stage-direction for the
use of it. The great poet is freely blamed for anachronisms; it is but
fair he should have due credit when he avoids them. The stories of his
plays are all antecedent to his own time, therefore he never mentions
either the _drinking of tobacco_, or the tumultuous scenes of the
_ordinary_ which belonged to it, and which are so constantly met with in
his cotemporary dramatists. I see there is a note in my commonplace-book,
after some remarks upon Green's _Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_, "that
this play, though written by a pedant, and a Master of Arts, contains
more anachronisms than any one play of Shakspeare's."

Can any of your correspondents learned in stage traditions say when this
"smoking interpolation" was first made?

       *       *       *       *       *

But, Sir, I think I shall surprise some of your readers by pointing out
another instance of the absence of tobacco or smoking. In the _Arabian
Night's Entertainments_, which are said to be such faithful pictures of
oriental manners, there is no mention of the pipe. Neither is coffee to
be met with in those tales, so delightful to all ages. We with difficulty
imagine an oriental without his _chibauk_; and yet it is certain they
knew nothing of this luxury before the sixteenth century. At present,
such is the almost imperious necessity felt by the Turk for smoking
and coffee, that as soon as the gun announces the setting of the sun,
during the fast of the Ramada, before he thinks of satisfying his craving
stomach with any solid food, he takes his cup of coffee and lights his
pipe.--As I think it dishonest to deck ourselves with knowledge that is
not self-acquired, I confess to the having but just read this "note"
in the last number of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, in a fine work upon
America by the celebrated savant, M. Ampère.

_Curious Epitaph._--In the _Diary of Thomas Moore_, Charles Lamb is said
at a certain dinner party to have "quoted an epitaph by Clio Rickman, in
which, after several lines in the usual jog-trot style of epitaph, he
continued thus:

    'He well perform'd the husband's, father's part,
    And knew immortal Hudibras by heart.'"

There is an epitaph in the churchyard of Newhaven, Sussex, in which
the last of these two lines occurs, but which does not answer in other
respects to the character of the one quoted by Lamb. On the contrary,
it is altogether eminently quaint, peculiar, and consistent. The stone
is to the memory of Thomas Tipper, who departed this life May the 14th,
1785, aged fifty-four years; and the upper part is embellished with a
representation, in bas-relief, of the drawbridge which crosses the river,
whence it might be inferred that the comprehensive genius of Mr. Tipper
included engineering and architecture. The epitaph runs thus:

    "Reader, with kind regard this grave survey,
    Nor heedless pass where Tipper's ashes lay.
    Honest he was, ingenuous, blunt and kind,
    And dared do what few dare do--speak his mind.
    Philosophy and History well he knew,
    Was versed in Physick and in Surgery too:
    The best old Stingo he both brew'd and sold,
    Nor did one knavish act to get his gold.
    He play'd through life a varied comic part,
    And knew immortal Hudibras by heart.
    Reader, in real truth this was the man:
    Be better, wiser, laugh more if you can."

Is there any reason for supposing this epitaph to have been written by
Clio Rickman; and is anything known of Mr. Tipper beyond the biography of
his tombstone?

_Enigmatical Epitaph._--I offer for solution an enigma, copied from a
tomb in the churchyard of Christchurch in Hampshire:

    "WE WERE NOT SLAYNE BUT RAYSD;

    BY MEN OF STRIFE.

The popular legend is, that the ten men perished by the falling in of a
gravel-pit, and that their remains were buried together. This, however,
will not account for the "men of strife."

Is it not probable that, in the time of the civil wars, the bodies might
have been disinterred for the sake of the leaden coffins, and then
deposited in their present resting-place?

_Books worthy to be reprinted_ (Vol. vii., pp. 153. 203.).--In addition
to those previously mentioned in "N. & Q.," there is one for which a
crying necessity exists for a new edition, namely, _The Complaynt of
Scotland_. It is often advertised and otherwise sought for; and when
found, can only be had at a most extravagant price. It was originally
written in 1548; and in 1801, a limited impression, edited by Dr. Leyden,
was published; and in 1829, "Critiques upon it by David Herd, and others,
with observations in answer by Dr. Leyden," to the number of seventy
copies. _The Complaynt of Scotland_ and _Sir Tristrem_, an edition of
which was edited by Sir Walter Scott, and published in 1804, are two of
the oldest works of which the literature of Scotland can boast.

INVERNESS.

_Napoleon's Thunderstorm._--The passage of the Niemen by the French army,
and its consequent entry on Russian territory, may be said to have been
Napoleon's first step towards defeat and ruin. A terrible thunderstorm
occurred on that occasion, according to M. Ségur's account of the Russian
campaign.

When Napoleon commenced the retreat, by which he yielded all the
country beyond the Elbe (and which, therefore, may be reckoned a second
step towards his downfall), it was accompanied by a thunderstorm more
remarkable from occurring at such a season. Odelben says:

    "C'était un phenomène bien extraordinaire dans un pareil
    saison, et avec le froid qu'on venait d'éprouver,"
    &c.--Odelben, _Camp. de 1813_, vol. i. p. 289.

The first step towards his second downfall, or third towards complete
ruin, was his advance upon the British force at Quatre-Bras, June 17,
1815. This also was accompanied by an awful thunderstorm, which (although
gathering all the forenoon) commenced at the very moment he made his
attack on the British rear-guard (about two p. m.), when the first gun
fired was instantaneously responded to by a tremendous peal of thunder.

Thunder, to Wellington, was the precursor of victory and triumph. Witness
the above-mentioned introduction to the victory of Waterloo; the terrible
thunder, that scattered the horses of the dragoons, the eve of Salamanca;
also, the night preceding Sabugal. And perhaps some of the Duke's old
companions in arms may be able to add to the category.

_Istamboul--Constantinople._--Mr. (afterwards Sir George) Wheler, who

(fol., Lond. 1682), p. 178.:

    "Constantinople is now vulgarly called _Stambol_ by the Turks;
    but by the Greeks more often _Istampoli_, which must needs be
    a corruption from the Greek ... either from Constantinopolis,
    which in process of time might be corrupted into _Stanpolis_
    or _Istanpoli_; or rather, from it being called πόλις κατ'
    ἐξοχήνο. For the Turks, hearing the Greeks express their going
    to Constantinople by εἰς τὴν πόλιν, which they pronounce
    Is-tin-polin, and often for brevity's sake Stinpoli, might
    soon ignorantly call it _Istanpoli_ or _Stambol_, according as
    either of them came into vogue first. And therefore I think
    theirs is a groundless fancy who fetch it from the Turkish word
    _Istamboal_, which signifies a city full of or abounding in the
    true faith, the name being so apparently of Greek original."

STRUT-STOWERS, AND YEATHERS OR YADDERS.

In the Collection of divers curious Historical Pieces printed by the Rev.
Francis Peck at the end of his _Memoirs of Oliver Cromwell_, is--

    "Some account of the Murder of the Hermit of Eskdale-side,
    near Whitby, in Com. Ebor. by William de Bruce (Lord of Ugle
    Barnby), Ralph de Peircy (Lord of Snealon), and one Allatson, a
    Gent., and of the remarkable penance which the Hermit enjoyned
    them before he died."

The story is briefly this:--On the 16th October, 15 Henry II., De Bruce,
De Peircy, and Allatson were hunting the wild boar in Eskdale-side, where
was a chapel and hermitage, in which lived a monk of Whitby, who was a
hermit. The boar being hotly pursued by the dogs, ran into the chapel and
there laid down and died. The hermit shut the door on the hounds, who
stood at bay without. The three gentlemen coming up, flew into a great
fury, and ran with their boar-staves at the hermit and so wounded him
that he ultimately died. The three gentlemen, fearing his death, took
sanctuary at Scarborough, but the Abbot of Whitby being in great favour
with the king, removed them out of sanctuary, whereby they became liable
to the law. The dying hermit (he survived till the 8th December), on the
abbot's proposing to put them to death, suggested the following penance,
to which, in order to save their lives and goods, they consented, and to
which the abbot likewise agreed:

    "You and yours shall hold your lands of the Abbat of Whitby and
    his successors after this manner, viz. upon the eve [or morrow
    before] Ascension Day, you, or some of you, shall come to the
    wood of Stray-Head, which is in Eskdale-side, by sun-rising,
    and there shall {149} the officer of the abbat blow his horn,
    that ye may know how to find him. And he shall deliver to you,
    William de Bruce, ten stakes, eleven strut-stowers, and eleven
    yeathers, to be cut by you, and those that come for you, with
    a knife of a penny price. And you Ralph de Peircy, shall take
    one and twenty of each sort, to be cut in the same manner.
    And you, Allatson, shall take nine of each sort, to be cut as
    aforesaid. And then ye shall take them on your backs, and carry
    them to the town of Whitby, and take care to be there before
    nine of the clock, and at the same hour, if it be a full sea,
    to cease your service. But, if it be low water at nine of the
    clock, then each of you shall, the same hour, set your stakes
    at the edge of the water, each stake a yard from the other,
    and so yeather them with your yeathers, and stake them on each
    side with your strut-stowers, that they may stand three tides,
    without removing by the force of the water. And each of you
    shall really do, perform, and execute this service yearly at
    the hour appointed, except it be a full sea, when this service
    shall cease; in remembrance that ye did most cruelly slay me.
    And that ye may the more seriously and fervently call upon God
    for mercy, and repent unfeignedly of your sins, and do good
    works, the officer of Eskdale-side shall blow, Out on you! Out
    on you! Out on you! for this heinous crime of yours. And if you
    or yours shall refuse this service at the aforesaid hour, when
    it shall not be a full sea, then you shall forfeit all your
    lands to the Abbat of Whitby and his successors."

There is a similar account, with verbal and other variations, "From a
printed copy published at Whitby a few years ago," in Blount's _Jocular
Tenures_, by Beckwith, pp. 557-560. In that account the word, which in
Mr. Peck's account is "yeathers," is "yadders." Mr. Beckwith states,
"This service is still annually performed."

Sir Walter Scott (_Marmion_, Canto II. st. 13.) thus alludes to the
legend:

    "Then Whitby's nuns exulting told,
    How to their house three Barons bold
      Must menial service do;
    While horns blow out a note of shame,
    And monks cry 'Fye upon your name!
    In wrath, for loss of silvan game,
      Saint Hilda's priest ye slew.'--
    'This on Ascension Day, each year,
    While labouring on our harbour pier,
    Must Herbert, Bruce, and Percy hear.'"

In note 2. C. the popular account printed and circulated at Whitby
is given. It is substantially the same with that given by Beckwith,
but for "strut-stowers" we have "strout-stowers;" and for "yadders"
we have "yethers." It appears, also, that the service was not at that
time performed by the proprietors in person; and that part of the lands
charged therewith were then held by a gentleman of the name of Herbert.

I shall be glad if any of your correspondents will elucidate the terms
strut-stowers, and yeathers or yadders.

_Amor Nummi._--Can any of your correspondents inform me as to the
authorship of the following verses?

    _Amor Nummi._

    "'The love of money is the root of evil,
    Sending the folks in cart-loads to the devil.'
    So says an ancient proverb, as we're told,
    And spoke the truth, we [no?] doubt, in days of old.
    But now, thanks to our good friend, BILLY PITT,
    This wholesome golden adage will not sit [fit?];
    On English ground the vice dissolves in vapour,
    Being at best only a love--of paper."

It must have appeared in an English ministerial paper about the year
1805.--From the _Navorscher_.

_The Number Nine._--Can any of your mathematical correspondents inform me

_Position of Font._--The usual and very significant position of the
font is near the church door. But there is one objection to this, viz.
that the benches being best arranged facing the chancel, the people
cannot without much confusion see the baptisms. This being so, perhaps
a better place {150} for the font is at the entrance of the chancel.
The holy rite, so edifying to the congregation, as well as profitable
to the recipient, can then be duly seen; and the position is tolerably
symbolical, expressing as it were "the way that is opened for us into the
holiest of all." I am curious to know if there are any ancient examples
of this position, and how far the canon sanctions it, which directs that
the font be set up in "the ancient usual _places_" [plural]? While on
the subject let me put another Query. The Rubric directs that the font
be "then," _i. e._ just before the baptism, filled with pure water. In
what vessel is the water brought, and who fills the font? What are the
precedents in this matter? Rules, I think, there are none.

local guidebooks attribute it to the time of Vortigern, or about 448; but
this seems an almost fabulous antiquity.

_"La Branche des réaus Lignages."_--Have any of your correspondents met
with a romance, of which I have a MS. copy, entitled "La Branche des
réaus Lignages?" The MS. I possess is evidently a modern copy, and begins
thus:

    "Et tens de celi mandement
    Duquel j'ai fait ramembrement
    Et qu'aucun homme d'avis oit
    Jehan, qui Henaut justisoit
    Guerréoit et grevoit yglises
    En la garde le roi commises
    Ne ... li vouloit faire hommage."

The poem is divided by numbers, probably referring to the pages of the
original: beginning with 1292, and ending with 1307. It is also evident,
from the first verses themselves, that I have only a fragment before
me.--From the _Navorscher_.

Babylon and Assyria: as Phalas-_sar_, Nebuchadnez-_zar_, &c. In Persian,
_sar_ means the supreme power. I have heard much argument about its
origin, and would be much obliged if any reader of "N. & Q." could state
the correct derivation of the word.

coins frequently found there.

_Leman Family._--About the middle of the seventeenth century, say 1650 to

been brothers or near relatives of Sir John Leman, who was Lord Mayor
of London in 1616. Traditions, which have been preserved in manuscript,
and which can be traced back over one {151} hundred years, tell of a
correspondence which took place between the said Sir John and the widow
of one of the brothers, in relation to her returning to England.

The writer of this (a descendant of one of these gentlemen) is anxious to
learn _the names of the brothers and near relatives of this Sir John_;
and whether any evidence exists of their leaving England for America,
&c., &c.; and would feel much indebted to any one who would supply the

_A Cob-wall._--Why do the inhabitants of Devonshire call a wall made of
tempered earth, straw, and small pebbles mixed together, a _cob-wall_?
Walls so constructed require a foundation of stone or bricks, which is
commonly continued to the height of about two feet from the surface of
the ground. Has the term _cob_ reference to the fact that such a wall is
a superstructure on the foundation of stone or brick?

_Inscription near Chalcedon._--In 1675, when Sir Geo. Wheler and his
travelling companion visited Chalcedon (as recorded in his _Voyage from
Venice to Constantinople_, fol., Lond. 1682, p. 209.), it was famous only
for the memory of the great council held there in A.D. 327, the twentieth
of the reign of Constantine the Great:

    "The first thing we did (he says) was to visit the metropolitan
    church, where they say it was kept; but M. Nanteuil assured us
    that it was a mile from thence, and that he had there read an
    inscription that mentioneth it. Besides, it is a small obscure
    building, incapable to contain such an assembly."

Has the inscription here spoken of been noticed by any traveller, and
can any of your readers refer to a copy of it; and say whether it is
cotemporary, and whether it has been more recently noticed?

terr. glđ wasta." Can any one inform me what it signifies?

In the case of many parishes, it is stated that there was a church there:
is it considered _conclusive_ authority that there was not one, if it is
not mentioned in _Domesday Book_?

_Dotinchem._--What modern town in Holland, or elsewhere, bore or bears
the name of Dotinchem, at which is dated a MS. missal I have inspected,
written in the fifteenth century? The reason for believing the place to
be Dutch is, that the Calendar marks the days of the principal saints of
Holland with red letters. There are other indications in the Calendar of
the missal having been written in and for the use of a community situated
where the influence of Cologne, Liège, Maestricht, and Daventer would
have been felt.

Perhaps, should the above Query not be answered in England, some
correspondent of your Dutch cotemporary the _Navorscher_ may have the

_Portrait of Charles I.--Countess Du Barry._--In Bachaumont's _Mémoires
Secrets, &c._, I read the following passage under date of March 25, 1771:

    "L'impératrice des Russies a fait enlever tout le cabinet de
    tableaux de M. le Comte de Thiers, amateur distingué, qui avait
    une très-belle collection en ce genre. M. de Marigny a eu la
    douleur de voir passer ces richesses chez l'étranger, faute de
    fonds pour les acquérir pour le compte du roi.

    "On distinguait parmi ces tableaux un portrait en pied de
    Charles I., roi d'Angleterre, original de Vandyk. C'est le
    seul qui soit resté en France. Madame la Comtesse Dubarri,
    qui déploie de plus en plus son goût pour les arts, a ordonné
    de l'acheter: elle l'a payé 24,000 livres. Et sur le reproche
    qu'on lui faisait de choisir un pareil morceau entre tant
    d'autres qui auraient dû lui mieux convenir, elle a répondu que
    c'était un portrait de famille qu'elle retirait. En effet, les
    Dubarri se prétendent parents de la Maison des Stuards."

Can you give me any account of this portrait of King Charles by Vandyk,
for which the Countess Du Barry paid the sum of 1000_l._ sterling?

What grounds are there for the allegation, that the Countess was related
to the royal House of Stuart?

Minor Queries with Answers.

_"Preparation for Martyrdom."_--Can any of your correspondents discover
for me the author of the following work?--

    "A Preparation for Martyrdom; a Discourse about the Cause,
    the Temper, the Assistances, and Rewards of a Martyr of Jesus
    Christ: in Dialogue betwixt a Minister and a Gentleman his
    Parishioner. Lond. 1681, 4to."

In order to afford somewhat of a clue to this discovery, I send a few
extracts from another anonymous work: _A Letter to the late Author of
the_ "_Preparation for Martyrdom_," alluding to various circumstances
relating to the author:

    "I must confess that I had once as great a veneration for
    you as for any one [of] your figure in the church; but then
    you preach'd honestly, and liv'd peaceably; but since pride
    or ambitious discontent, or some particular respects to some
    special friends of the adverse party, or something I know not
    what else, has thrust you upon scribbling, and a design of
    being popular; since you had forsaken your first love (if ever
    you had any) to our church and establishment, and appear to
    be running over _ad partem Donati_, to the disturbers of our
    church and peace, you must needs pardon this short reflection,
    though from an old friend, and sometimes a great admirer of you.

    "As for the present establishment, you have (you conclude)
    as much already from that as you are likely to have, but you
    claw the democratical party, hoping at long run to see an
    (_English_) Parliament; that is, we must know, one that has
    no _French_ pensioners shuffled into it to blast the whole
    business, such as will be govern'd by your instructions; and
    then Presbytery (you trust) will be turn'd up Trump, the
    Directory once more take place of the Liturgy, and God knows
    what become of the Monarchy, and Mr. C. be made a great man.

    "What an excellent design was that of your Stipulation, which
    I heard one say was like a new modell'd Independency. 'Twas
    intended, I suppose, as an expedient to reduce the sheep
    of your own flock, which through your default chiefly (as
    is commonly reported) were gone astray; but because this
    tool could not work, without the force of a law to move it,
    therefore by law it must have been establisht, and the whole
    nation forsooth comprehended under it, and all must have set
    their instruments to your key, and their voices to the tune of
    _B--ley_. Oh! had this engine but met with firm footings in
    Parliament, as was hoped, our _English_ world had been lifted
    off its pillars long before this day; it had gone round, and in
    the church all old things had been done away, and everything
    had appeared new. But, Sir, I trust the foundations of our
    church stand more sure than to need such silly props as your
    _Catholicon_ (as you vainly call it) to support 'em.

    "What an excellent thing too is your book of Patronage? 'Twere
    no living for _Simon Magus_, or any of his disciples here, if
    those rules you there lay down were but duly attended to.

    "But in those two books you showed yourself pragmatical
    only; but in this of _Martyrdom_ not a little impious, in
    your unworthy reflections upon almost all the honest people
    of England since the beginning of the reign of _Oliver_ the
    First, and some time before; not sparing many loyal worthies'
    memory who held up a good cause upon their sword points (as you
    express it) as long as they could; and when they could do so no
    longer, either dy'd for't, or deliver'd themselves up to the
    will of the conqueror, yet never (as you) abjur'd the cause.
    Our rulers you suppose are ill affected (otherwise your talk
    of Popery at your rate is like that of one that were desirous
    and in conspiracy to bring in Popery): and, undoubtedly, it had
    been in already, had not the prayers of Mr. C., and the fifty
    righteous _Non-Cons_ in every city, prevented it."

[_The Preparation for Martyrdom_ is not to be found either in the
Bodleian or British Museum Catalogues. The author of the _Letter_ in
reply to it, however, has afforded a clue to its authorship. Zachary
Cawdrey, who appears to have been an admirer of the Vicar of Bray, was
Rector of _Barthomley_ in Cheshire during the Commonwealth, and for
fourteen years after the Restoration; this explains the hint in the
_Letter_, of "setting their voices to the tune of _B--ley_." Cawdrey,
moreover, was the author of _Discourse of Patronage; being a Modest
Inquiry into the Original of it, and a further Prosecution of the History
of it_: which is also noticed in the _Letter_. Zachary Cawdrey was born
at Melton Mowbray about 1616; at the age of sixteen he entered St. John's
College, Cambridge; and in 1649 became Rector of Barthomley, where he
died Dec. 24, 1684. His brother David was one of the ejected, and the
author of several works.]

    it pray for the same Daniel, that he may find mercy in the day

    wrote it, may there be mercy in the day of judgment! Amen. But
    at the end of his life he bequeathed it to this sacred convent
    of my Lord Silas, which is in Tarug (a city of Mesopotamia),
    for the sake of the remembrance of himself and of the dead
    belonging to him. May the Lord have mercy upon him in the day

THE DRUMMER'S LETTER.

(Vol. vii., p. 431.)

Mr. Forbes rightly describes the Drummer's Letter in the _Sentimental
Journey_ as "not only correctly but elegantly written." There is,
moreover, in two or three places, a play upon words, which indicates an
intimate acquaintance with the idiomatic turns of the language. But all
these circumstances are, to my mind, only so many grounds for the belief
that the French of the letter is not Sterne's.

If we are to judge of Sterne's French from the samples to be met with in
_Tristram Shandy_ and the _Sentimental Journal_, there is ample evidence
that his knowledge of that language was somewhat superficial. I shall
give a few examples.

Your readers are familiar with the incident in _Tristram Shandy_, where
the Abbess and Margarita, having occasion to make use of two very coarse
and indecent expressions, resort to the ludicrous expedient of splitting
them in two, each pronouncing a separate syllable. Those words are
scandalously common in the mouths of Frenchmen; and yet Sterne seems so
little aware of the correct spelling of them, that he makes the poor nuns
give utterance to two words, one of which, "bouger," means "to move," and
the other, "fouter," is unknown to the French language.

Farther on, in chapter xxxiv., the commissary employs the expression
"C'est tout égal;" but this is merely the translation of our English
phrase "'Tis all one." The French say "C'est égal," but never "C'est tout
égal."

In the _Sentimental Journey_, under the head of "The Bidet," La Fleur is
made to say "C'est _un_ cheval le plus opiniâtre du monde." Now, the man
who could write the Drummer's Letter would not have applied the epithet
"opiniâtre" {154} to a horse; and, at any rate, he would have said
"C'est _le_ cheval le plus opiniâtre du monde."

In the chapter headed "The Passport," and also in another place, we have
the phrase "Ces Messieurs Anglais sont des gens très extraordinaires."
This should be "Messieurs les Anglais," &c.

Again, under the head of "Characters," Count de B. says, "But if you do
support it, _M. Anglais_, you must do it with all your powers." This
"M. Anglais" is our "Mr. Englishman." The correct expression is "M.
l'Anglais"--Mr. _the_ Englishman.

I might add other instances; but these, I trust, are sufficient to
warrant the opinion that the Drummer's Letter, in its present shape, was
not written by Sterne.

OLD FOGIES.

(Vol. vii., p. 632.)

At the place above referred to, MR. KEIGHTLEY puts to me several Queries;
but being resident in the country, I had not an opportunity of seeing
them till the 15th instant, and it took some days to get the information
that would enable me to answer them.

I have now obtained the most ample evidence of the existence, in the
latter part of the last, and the beginning of the present, centuries, of
the existence of a peculiar body of men called the _Fogies_, in Edinburgh
Castle. My informants agree in describing them as old men, dressed in
red coats with apple-green facings, and cocked hats. One says that they
fired the Castle guns; another says that he understood them to be the
keepers, or, as we might say, the warders of the Castle, and that they
were sometimes brought into the town to assist in quelling riots; and
this gentleman's recollection of them goes back to 1784 at least. But the
oldest date I have been able to get is from a much respected friend, the
retired Town Clerk of Edinburgh, who writes to me thus: "I have a most
vivid recollection of the _Castle Foggies_. They were an invalid company,
and my recollection of them goes as far back at least as 1780, when I was
at Stalker's English school in the Lawnmarket."

To the testimony of these still living witnesses, I have to add that of
Dr. Jamieson, who gives the word in his _Dictionary_ as one of common
and well-known use in Scotland in his time, 1759-1808; though he may
have mistaken in supposing it to be exclusively Scottish. It was for his
testimony to this _fact_ that I referred to Dr. Jamieson's _Dictionary_,
and not for his etymology, for I am not so much of a "true Scot" as
to consider him infallible in that department. I have not leisure at
present to search any farther for the word in books, but in the meantime
I presume to think the evidence I have procured of its use in Scotland,
will carry us nearly as far back as MR. KEIGHTLEY'S for its use in
Ireland.

I cannot pretend to much acquaintance with the Swedish language, but
I was quite well aware that that "is what is meant by the mysterious
Su.-G." I was also aware that in the kindred Teutonic tongues the word
runs through the various forms of _vogt_, _fogat_, _phogat_, _voget_,
_voogd_, _fogde_, _foged_, _fogeti_, with the meaning of bailiff,
steward, preses, watchman, guard or protector, tutor, overseer, judge,
mayor, policeman; and I doubt not that _fogie_ belongs to the same
family, though it has lost its tail. MR. KEIGHTLEY does not need to
be told that words frequently degenerate in meaning, falling from the
noblest to the basest, from the purest to the most obscene. Is there then
anything improbable in supposing that a word once applied to the governor
or chief keeper of a castle, came at last to be applied to all, even the
meanest, of his subordinates? Dr. Jamieson asserts that the word _fogde_
in the Su.-G. has actually had that fate; can MR. KEIGHTLEY controvert
him?

As a proof, _quantum valeat_, that the _Castle fogies_ were so called for
some other reason than merely because of their being "old folks," I may
mention that there was in Edinburgh, for more than a century, another
body of veterans, called the Town Guard, or City Guard, maintained by the
magistrates as a sort of military police, or gendarmerie, and finally
disbanded in 1817. This corps was generally recruited from old soldiers;
and during the period of my acquaintance with them (9½ years) they were
all aged, and some of them very old men; yet I never heard the word
_fogies_ applied to them. On the contrary, they were always distinguished
from the fogies by the elegant appellation of the "Toon Rottens," or Town
Rats, as well as by their facings, which were _dark blue_. Some, indeed,
of my younger friends, who remember the "Rats" very well, say they never
heard of the "Fogies" at all; only one of them, who lived when a boy at
the Castle Hill, perhaps about forty years ago, recollects of the word
"fogie" as being then applied to the soldiers of the ordinary veteran or
garrison battalions, with blue facings, that had superseded the fogies in
the keeping of the Castle; but of the veritable apple-green fogies of the
older establishment, he has no remembrance. As my own recollections of
Edinburgh go back to 1808, the fogies, I presume, must have been by that
time extinct, for I never saw any of them, though I frequently heard them
spoken of by those who had seen them.

I may mention also that while "fogie" was in use, and of well understood
application in Scotland, {155} the phrase "old folks," or, to write it
according to our vernacular pronunciation, "auld fo'k," was also, and
continues to be, in general and familiar use; but nobody in Scotland, I
dare say, ever imagined that "the auld fo'k" of his ordinary acquaintance
were just "old fogies," or had anything whatever to do with that peculiar
class of men, properly so called, the keepers of the royal castles. It
is most remarkable, also, that while the corrupt derivative, as MR.
KEIGHTLEY says "old fogie" is, has been almost quite forgotten among us,
having disappeared with the men that bore the name of fogies, the parent
form, as he would have "old folks" or "auld fo'k" to be, should remain
in full vigour and common use, as part of our living speech. In a word,
from all I can learn it would appear that the word "fogie," in its most
general acceptation, means by itself, without the "old," an old soldier;
and that "old fogie" is only a tautological form, arising from ignorance
of its meaning. Be its origin, however, what it may, I have no hesitation
now in expressing my conviction that MR. KEIGHTLEY'S etymology of the
word is utterly groundless.

DESCENDANTS OF JOHN OF GAUNT.

(Vol. vii., p. 628.)

All persons will, I think, agree with MR. WARDEN in his very just
complaint of the carelessness with which many of the English Peerages
are compiled. It would be a task, little short of a new compilation, to
correct the errors and inaccuracies with which many of these productions
abound, the less pardonable now, because of the facilities afforded
for consulting the Public Records, should even our older genealogists,
without such aids, be in some degree excused; but as MR. WARDEN invites,
by a personal appeal, the rectification of a chronological error which
has crept into all the Peerages, founded upon the authority of Dugdale,
respecting the period of the death of Thomas, sixth Lord Fauconberge, I
am induced to send you a few Notes, which a recent examination of the
Records in the Tower of London has supplied.

When the facts are made patent, there will be no need to dwell upon
the inconsistencies pointed out by MR. WARDEN, and the alleged
incompatibility in regard to age for an union between two persons of
some note in family history, the son of the first Earl of Westmoreland
and his Countess Joan and the daughter and heir of the Lord Fauconberge,
who formed an alliance from which the co-heirs are, it is believed,
represented at this day.

The birth of William Nevill, Lord Fauconberge, afterwards created Earl of
Kent, second son of a marriage which took place early in, or just before,
the year 1397, may be assigned to in or about the year 1400; and we shall
presently see that his future wife was born on the 18th of October, 1406,
and married to him before the 1st of May, 1422.

Walter, fifth Lord Fauconberge, died on the 29th of September, 1362
(Esc. 36 Edw. III., 1st part, No. 77.), leaving a son Thomas (issue of
his first marriage with Matilda, sister and co-heir of Sir William de
Pateshull, Kt., Esc. 33 Edw. III., 1st part, No. 40., and _Rot. Orig._,
34 Edw. III., Ro. 2.), then a minor, under eighteen years of age.

Thomas, who was born circa 1345, was already in 1362 married to his
first wife Constancia, by whom he does not appear to have left any issue
surviving. His was rather an eventful life; some incidents not noticed by
Dugdale will be briefly cited. On the 10th of August, 1372, being then a
knight or chivaler, he had letters of protection on going abroad in the
king's service, in the company of Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick
(_Rot. Franc._, 46 Edw. III.). Here it seems he forgot his allegiance,
and having gone over to the French side was branded "tanquam proditor
domini Regis Angliæ" (Esc. 5 Ric. II., No. 67., 6 Ric. II., No. 180.,
and 11 Ric. II., No. 59.). Can this have been the origin of the error
in assigning his death to the year 1376? He was, however, yet living
in 1401, as in that year he succeeded to the reversion of the estates
which his step-mother Isabella (a sister of Sir John Bygot, Chivaler),
the widow of Walter Lord Fauconberge, held in dower (Esc. 2 Hen. IV.,
No. 47.). Not long after this, and apparently a few years only before
his death, and when somewhat advanced in years, he married a second
time. I have not been able to ascertain to what family his wife Joan, or
Johanna, belonged, but she survived her husband only a short time. About
the period of his marriage, too (9th August, 1405), an occurrence of
some importance to his descendants is recorded, namely, a grant by the
king to Sir Thomas Bromflete and Sir Robert Hilton, of the custody and
governance of all his estates in England, which had come into the king's
hands "ratione ideociæ Thomæ Fauconberge, Chivaler," to hold during the
life of the said Thomas. This grant, however, was in the following year,
on 24th December, 1406, revoked and annulled, because the said Thomas
had proved before the king and his council in Chancery, "quod ipse sanæ
discretionis hactenus fuerit et ad tunc existat," and he was thereupon
re-admitted to his estates which had descended to him "jure hæreditario
post mortem Walteri Fauconberge patris sui, cujus hæres ipse est" (_Rot.
Pat._, p. 1., 8 Hen. IV., m. 16.). He had only a few months before (15th
February, 1406) obtained from the king livery of an estate which had come
to him in {156} 1375 as one of the co-heirs, on his mother's side, of
his grandmother Mabilia, a sister of Otho de Graunson, upon the death
without issue of Thomas de Graunson, son of the said Otho. (_Rot. Pat._,
p. 1., 7 Hen. IV., m. 6.)

Was there in fact any real ground for the suggestion of Lord
Fauconberge's idiocy? This is one of the gravest imputations that can
be cast upon a family, and it is a most unpardonable presumption to
make it lightly and without justice; but it is somewhat singular that
nearly fifty years afterwards, his only daughter and heir, born at the
very period when this charge was being refuted, and when he himself was
upwards of sixty years of age, became the subject of a commission issued
to inquire of her alleged imbecility and idiocy. The commissioners sat at
Gisburn in Cleveland in the county of York, on the 28th of March, 1463,
and it was then found by the inquest that "Johanna Fauconberge nuper
comitissa de Kent, fatua et ydeota est, et a nativitate sua semper fuit,
ita quod se terras et tenementa sua neque alia bona sua regere scit, aut
aliquo tempore scivit:" the jury also returned that she had not alienated
any lands or tenements since the death of William, late Earl of Kent,
her late husband. That Joan, the wife of Sir Edward Bethom, Kt., thirty
years old and upwards, Elizabeth, the wife of Richard Strangeways, Esq.,
twenty-eight years old and upwards, and Alice, wife of John Conyers,
Esq., twenty-six years old and upwards, were the daughters and heirs,
as well of the said William the late earl, as of the said Joan the late
countess. (Esc. 3 Edw. IV., No. 33.)

Thomas Lord Fauconberge died on the 9th of September, 1407, leaving the
above-mentioned Joan, or Johanna, his daughter and heir, an infant of one
year old. (Esc. 9 Hen. IV., No. 19.; see also Esc. 9 Hen. V., No. 42.)
His widow Joan had assignment of dower after her husband's death on 20th
October, 1408, and she herself died in the following year, on the 4th of
March, 1409. (Esc. 10 Hen. IV., No. 15.) A later inquisition, however,
taken on 1st of April, 1422 (Esc. 10 Hen. V., No. 22ᵃ.), states that the
said Joan, widow of Sir Thomas Fauconberge, Chivaler, died on the 23rd of
June, 1411. The first date is most probably the correct one, as a fact
would be more likely to be accurately stated by a jury impanneled a few
months only after the event recorded, than by an inquest taken after an
interval of twelve or thirteen years.

On the formal proof of age (Esc. 10 Hen. V., No. 22ᵇ.) of Joan
Fauconberge, daughter and heir of Thomas Lord Fauconberge and Joan his
wife, taken at Northallerton, in the county of York, on the 1st of May,
10 Henry V., 1422, she was described as the wife of William Neville. She
appears to have been born at Skelton in the said county, and baptized
in the church there on the feast of Saint Luke the Evangelist (18th of
October), 1406; and on the same feast in 1421, being the 9th of Henry V.,
she had accomplished her fifteenth year. Dugdale (tom. ii. p. 4.) has
fallen into a singular mistake in alluding to this event, not to speak of
the obvious inconsistency which those writers who follow his account have
introduced in assigning the year of Lord Fauconberge's decease to 1372,
thus making the daughter's birth to have occurred more than thirty years
after her father's death. It is this:--One of the witnesses, who speaks
to the period of the baptism of Joan, was named _Thomas_ Blawefrount the
elder, fifty years of age and upwards, and the reason assigned by him for
his remembrance of the event is as follows: "Et hoc scit eo quod Isabella
filia prædicti Thomæ desponsata fuit cuidam Johanni Wilton, et idem
Thomas fuit ad sponsalia eodem die quo præfata Johanna baptizata fuit,
propter quod bene recolit quod præfata Johanna fuit ætatis prædictæ."
Dugdale has by a strange oversight made the Isabella here described to be
the daughter of Thomas Fauconberge, and sister of Joan, instead of the
witness' own daughter.

It is not quite evident, from the language of the document which records
the imbecility of the Countess of Kent in March 1463, whether she was
then actually dead. It appears, however, clear that she survived her
husband, who lived but a few months to enjoy his newly acquired dignity.

The account given by Dugdale of John, son of Thomas Lord Fauconberge,
is scarcely intelligible. He says this lord "left issue John, his son
and heir," and subsequently adds, "which John died without issue in the
lifetime of his father."

Lord Fauconberge may have had a son by his former wife, but I have
seen nothing to confirm this supposition. By an inquisition taken
after the death of Sir Walter Fauconberge, Chivaler, at Bedford, on
the 18th of November, 1415, it was found that Joan, widow of one Sir
John Fauconberge, Chivaler, deceased, whom Thomas Brounflete, junior,
afterwards married, was then living, and that she granted to the said Sir
Walter all the estate which she had in certain rents payable by Matilda
Wake, formerly the wife of Sir Thomas Wake, Chivaler; that the said Sir
Walter died on the 1st of September, 1415, but the jurors knew not who
was his heir. (Esc. 3 Hen. V., No. 15.) Dugdale (vol. ii. p. 234.) cites
a feoffment dated 9 Hen. IV., 1407-8, which shows that Thomas Brounflete,
Esq., was then married to the said Joan, and consequently that Sir John
Fauconberge was dead at that time.

I must close this, for I fear I have now exceeded the limits which your
valuable paper may, with justice to others, spare to subjects of this
nature.

PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.

_Lining of Cameras._--I find nothing so good to line a camera with as
_black velvet_; for, black the inside of a camera as you will, if it is
hard wood or any size used, there will be reflection from the bottom,
which, with very sensitive plates, gives a dulness which, I think I may
say, is caused by this reflection. I think even the inside of the lens
tube might advantageously be lined with black velvet.

W. M. F.

_Cyanuret of Potassium._--I have been using lately 12 grs. of cyanuret of
potassium in 1 oz. of water for clearing the collodion plates, instead
of hypo. There is one advantage, that there are no crystals formed if
imperfectly washed, which is too common with hypo. You must take care to
well wash off the developing fluid, whether pyrogallic, protonitrate,
or protosulphite: if you use the latter 40-grains strong, the _whitest_
pictures can be obtained, nearly as white as after bichloride of mercury.
A good formula to make it is--

    Distilled water                 11 drachms.
    Alcohol                          1 drachm.
    Nitric acid                     20 minims.
    Protosulphate of iron           60 grains.

This I know to act well with care, and it will keep a long time.

    Protosulph.                    150    "

mixed in a proportion of 8 to 4, with a 3-grain solution of pyrogallic--a
very nice developing mixture; and, if poured back again after being used,
will suffice 6 or 8 times over; but it is _best_ new.

_Minuteness of Detail on Paper._--Being fond of antiquarian studies,
and having learned from "N. & Q." the value of photography to the
archæologist, I have serious thoughts of taking up the practice of
the art. Before doing so, however, I am anxious to learn how far that
minuteness of detail which I so much prize, and which is of such value to
the antiquary, is to be obtained by any of the processes on paper. I have
seen some specimens produced by collodion which certainly exhibit that
quality in an eminent degree. Is anything approaching to such minuteness
attainable by any of the Talbotype processes?

F. S. A.

[Had this Query reached us last week, we should then, as now, have
replied in the affirmative. We should then have referred, for evidence
in support of our statement, to Mr. Fenton's Well Walk, Cheltenham,
published in the _Photographic Album_, and to Mr. Buckle's View of
Peterborough. But we may now adduce a work almost more remarkable for
this quality, namely, a view of Salisbury, by Mr. Russell Sedgefield, a
young wood engraver, which is about to appear in the forthcoming part of
the _Photographic Album_.

To this beautiful specimen of the art we may certainly refer as a proof
that it is quite possible to obtain upon paper the greatest nicety of
detail; in short, every minuteness that can be desired, or ought to be
attempted.]

_Stereoscopic Angles._--I think there can be little doubt that MR. T. L.
MERRITT (Vol. viii., p. 110.) has solved the problem as to stereoscopic
angles: there can be no reason why one angle should be used for _near_
objects, and another for _distant_. A _true_ representation of nature is
required: and, as we cannot view any object with one of our eyes eighteen
or twenty feet separate from the other, so it appears to me a true
picture cannot be obtained by taking two views so far apart. The result
must be to _dwarf_ the objects; and, in confirmation of this, I may state
that I was not convinced that the stereoscopic views were taken from
nature till I understood the cause of their reduction. All views that I
have been able to purchase, of out-door nature, appear to me to be taken
from models, and not from the objects themselves.

A view of a tower conveys the idea, not of a tower of stone and lime, but
of a very careful model in cardboard; and this is exactly what might be
expected from taking the views at so wide an angle. A church is seen, as
it would be seen by a giant whose eyes were twenty feet apart, or as we
would see a small model of it near at hand.

I hope that some of your photographic correspondents will settle this
question, by taking views of the same object both by the wide and close
angle, and, by comparing them, ascertain which conveys to the mind the
truest representation of nature.

_Sisson's developing Solution_ (Vol. vii., p. 462.).--Will you be so good
as to ask MR. SISSON if he finds the above to answer as a bath to plunge
the plate _into_, instead of pouring on, as in the case of pyrogallic?

He is entitled to the warm thanks of all photographers for the discovery
of a solution which produces such pleasing tints with so much ease; and
it needs but the qualification I inquire after to render it perfect. I
have used it when at least three weeks made, and am not sure that it is
not even better than when fresh.

In the last number of the _Photographic Journal_ (21st ult.), some
mention is made of this letter. They say it proves to be one already
long in use, Mr. Kilburn having practised it for four years. I am very
desirous of obtaining more information about it. I want to know the
length of the box or camera required; and also the focus of the lens, and
the best size. Probably Mr. Kilburn or Sir W. Herschel would one of them
be so kind as to say.

Would you have the goodness to explain, in some detail, the two methods
by which Mr. Stewart and Mr. Kilburn multiply photographs in a reduced
or magnified size; the one by reflected light, the other by transmitted.
Mr. Stewart's experiments are upon glass, Mr. Kilburn's on cameras and
daguerreotypes. I have never seen any description of this latter process,
or of the method of preparing the stereoscope objects: vide _Athenæum_,
July 30, 1853.

_Is it dangerous to use the Ammonio-Nitrate of Silver?_ (Vol. viii.,
p. 134.).--No: it is now generally used as the best of _marking inks,
without preparation_; and we have never yet heard of an explosion from
its use. Mr. Delamotte has evidently confounded this preparation with
the chloride of silver precipitated with _strong ammonia_, which, when
dried, forms the article known as _fulminating silver_; or by adding
to the oxide of silver lime-water, and afterwards a strong solution of
ammonia, a black powder is thrown down, which, when dried, is known as
_Berthollet's fulminating silver_. There is also one other, formed by
adding chloric acid to oxide of silver; after drying this, and then
adding potassa to a solution of it, the precipitate, by again being
dried, becomes an explosive compound.

The photographer forms a weak solution for his purpose with one of the
least soluble and _weakest_ of the ammoniacal preparations, and which,
by drying _around the stopper of the bottle_, is very unlikely to become
explosive, from its wanting the addition of another element as necessary
to the formation of an explosive compound. For my own part, I must say,
that I have found, from experience, all the compound solutions of silver
keep much better, and the photogenic effect more satisfactory, by mixing
only so much as I may require for immediate use, at this time of the year
especially.

Anthony Fitzherbert was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas

Serjeant-at-law in 1554, and one of the Justices of the Common Pleas

"Serjeant-at-law" in the title-page of the book when he made a new table
to its contents, that the complimentary style of Reverend, as applicable
to the judges, was used at least as late as the middle of the sixteenth
century.

_Jacob Bobart_ (Vol. viii., p. 37.).--I beg to supply the following
additional particulars relating to the Bobart family. In the
_Correspondence of Dr. Richardson_, edited by Mr. Dawson Turner, will
be found a letter from Bobart junior to the Doctor, with a reference to
two other letters. In pages 9, 10, and 11, a copious note respecting
the Bobart family, by the editor, is given. A short notice of Bobart
jun. also appears in the Memoirs of John Martyn, Professor of Botany at
Cambridge. The following epitaph on Bobart jun. is in Amherst's _Terræ
Filius_, 1726:

    "Here lies Jacob Bobart,
    Nail'd up in a cupboard."

In the preface to Mr. Nichols' work on _Autographs_, among other albums
noticed by him as being in the British Museum, is that of David Krieg,
with Jacob Bobart's autograph, and the following verses:

    "VIRTUS SUA GLORIA.

    Think that day lost whose descending sun,
    Views from thy hand no noble action done.

    Your success and happyness

    Is sincerely wished by

    JA. BOBART, Oxford."

Mr. Richardson's engraved portrait of Bobart the Elder is only a copy
of Burghers' engraving, so highly spoken of by Granger, and cannot,
therefore, be nearly so valuable as the latter.

_"Putting your foot into it"_ (Vol. viii., p. 77.).--W. W. is certainly
"Will o' the Wisp" himself. We must not allow him to lead us into Asia,
hunting for the origin of a saying which is nothing more than a coarse
allusion to an accident that happens day after day to every heedless or
benighted pedestrian in England; but if a foreign origin _must_ be found
for this saying, let us travel to Greece rather than to Hindostan, and we
shall see in the writings of Æschylus:

    "Ἐλαφρὸν, ὅστις πημάτων ἔξω πόδα
    Ἔχει, παραινεῖν νουθετεῖν τε τὸν κακῶς
    Πράσσοντ'." κ.τ.λ.--_Prom. Vinc._ 271.

following use of this simile in Thomas Hood's poem, addressed to Rae
Wilson:

    "Spontaneously to God should tend the soul,
    Like the magnetic needle to the Pole;
    But what were that intrinsic virtue worth,
    Suppose some fellow, with more zeal than knowledge,
      Fresh from St. Andrew's College,
    Should nail the conscious needle to the north?"

_The Tragedy of Polidus_ (Vol. vii., p. 499.).--This tragedy, printed at
London 1723, 12mo., has a farce appended to it called _All Bedevil'd, or
the House in a Hurry_. Browne was patronised by Hervey, the author of the
_Meditations_. The scene of the drama is in Cyprus. The lover of Polidus,
"the banished general," and Rosetta, daughter to Orlont, chief favourite
to the king, form the groundwork of the plot. My copy was formerly in
the collection of plays which belonged to Stephen Jones, author of the
_Biographia Dramatica_.

_Robert Fairlie_ (Vol. vii., p. 581.).--In answer to the Query as to
Robert Fairley, or more properly Fairlie, I may mention that there is
in my possession a presentation by the Faculty of Advocates, dated July
27, 1622, to "Robert Fairlie, son lawfull to Umquhill Robert Fairlie,
goldsmith, Burgh of Edinburgh, to the said bursar place and haill
immunities quhill he pass his course of Philosophie," in the College of
Edinburgh. This undoubtedly was the author of the two very rare little
poetical volumes referred to; and it proves, from the use of the word
"Umquhill," that his father was then dead.

There is an error in stating that the _Kalendarium_ is dedicated to the
Earl of Ancrum. In the copy before me it is inscribed "Illustrissimo et
Nobilissimo Domino, Domino Roberto Karo Comiti a Summerset," &c. The
other work is the one dedicated to Lord Ancrum. I have both works, and
they certainly were costly, as I gave five guineas for them. They had
originally been priced at ten guineas.

A _Bursary_, according to Jamieson, is "the endowment given to a student
in a university, an exhibition." It is believed that Fairlie was of the
Ayrshire family of that name.

_"Mater ait natæ," &c._ (Vol. vii., pp. 247, 248.).--When calling
attention to these lines in "N. & Q." (Vol. vii., p. 155.), I at the same
time asked if such a relationship as that mentioned in them was ever
known to exist? This Query was very kindly and satisfactorily answered by
your correspondents ANON and TYE. But, remarkable as were the instances
mentioned by them of the two old ladies in Cheshire and Limington,
who could speak to their descendants in a female line to the fifth
generation, still that I am now to record of an old man in Montenegro is
much more singular, as he could converse with his lineal descendants in
an uninterrupted _male_ line one generation farther from him, (i. e.)
to the sixth. The case is too well authenticated to admit of a doubt,
and until some one of your correspondents shall favour me with another
equally to be credited, it will remain in the columns of "N. & Q." as the
only one known to its readers:--

    "Colonel Vialla de Sommières, a Frenchman, who was for a long
    time governor of the province of Catano, mentions a family he
    saw in a village of Montenegro, which reckoned six generations.
    The venerable head of the family was 117 years old, his son
    100, his grandson 82, great-grandson 60, and the son of this
    last, who was 43, had a son aged 21, whose child was 2 years
    old!"

Query. Now, Mr. Davenport, in his _Biog. Dict._, p. 546. (wherein is
a wood-engraved portrait of Sir John), states that he was born in
London, about 1672; but, supposing his place of nativity was, as your
correspondent suggests, Chester, it might very easily be ascertained by
searching the parochial register of that city in or about the above year.

_Murder of Monaldeschi_ (Vol. viii., p. 34.).--The following account
of this event is taken from the _Biographie Universelle_, article
"Christine, reine de Suède:"

    "Cet Italien avait joui de toute la confiance de la reine,
    qui lui avait révélé ses pensées les plus secrètes. Arrivée
    à Fontainebleau, elle l'accusa de trahison, et résolut de le
    faire mourir. Un religieux de l'ordre de la Trinité, le P.
    Lebel, fut appelé pour le préparer à la mort. Monaldeschi se
    jeta aux pieds de la reine et fondit en larmes. Le religieux,
    qui a publié lui-même un récit de l'événement, fit à Christine
    les plus fortes représentations sur cet acte de vengeance
    qu'elle voulait exercer arbitrairement dans une terre étrangère
    et dans le palais d'un grand souverain; mais elle resta
    inflexible, et ordonna à Sentinelli, capitaine de ses gardes,
    de faire exécuter l'arrêt qu'elle avait prononcé. Monaldeschi,
    soupçonnant le danger qu'il courait, s'était cuirassé: il
    fallut le frapper de plusieurs coups avant qu'il expirât, et
    la galerie des Cerfs, où se passa cette scène révoltante, fut
    teinte de son sang. Pendant ce temps, Christine, au rapport
    de plusieurs historiens, était dans une pièce attenante,
    s'entretenant avec beaucoup de calme de choses indifférentes;
    selon d'autres rapports, elle fut présente à l'exécution,
    accabla Monaldeschi de reproches amers, et contempla ensuite
    son cadavre sanglant avec une satisfaction qu'elle ne chercha
    point à dissimuler. Que ces détails soient fondés ou non, la
    mort de Monaldeschi est une tache ineffaçable à la mémoire de
    Christine, et c'est à regret qu'on voit sur la liste de ses
    apologistes le nom du fameux Leibnitz."

In the answer which Queen Christina sent to the objections made in Poland
to her election as their sovereign, occurs the following passage:

    "Le Père dira en témoignage de la vérité, que cet homme me
    força de le faire mourir par la trahison la plus noire qu'un
    serviteur puisse faire à son maître; que je n'ordonnai sa
    mort, qu'après l'avoir convaincu de son crime par les lettres
    en original écrites de sa propre main, et après de lui avoir
    fait avouer à lui-même, en présence de trois témoins, et du
    Père prieur de Fontainebleau: qu'ils savent qu'il dit lui-même:
    'Je suis digne de mille morts,' et que je lui fis donner
    les sacremens dont il était capable avant que de le faire
    mourir."--_Mémoires concernant Christine_, Amst. et Leipzig,
    1759, tom. iii. pp. 386-7.

_Land of Green Ginger_ (Vol. viii., p. 34.).--It is so called from the
sale of ginger having been chiefly carried on there in early times. As
far as I can recollect, none of the local histories gives any derivation
of the name; those of Gent and Frost certainly do not, and this is the
one generally received by the inhabitants. Salthouse Lane and Blanket
Row are other streets, which may be referred to as having obtained their
names in a similar way.

An inhabitant of Hull has informed me that this street was so named by a
house-proprietor whose fortune had been made in the West Indies, and I

_Unneath_ (Vol. vii., p. 631.).--It strikes me that your correspondents
MR. C. H. COOPER and E. G. R., in reply to MR. WRIGHT'S inquiry
respecting the {161} use of the word "unneath," used in Parnell's
_Fairy Tale_, have fallen into a slight mistake in supposing that the
seemingly old words used in this poem are really so. I make no doubt
that MR. HALLIWELL is correct in noting the word "unneath" as signifying
"beneath," in the _patois_ of Somerset; but I gravely suspect that
Parnell had picked up the word out of our older poets, and used it in the
passage quoted without consideration.

The true meaning of "unneath" (which is of Saxon origin, and variously
written "unnethe, unnethes") is _scarcely_, _not easily_.

Thus Chaucer says:

    "The miller that for-dronken was all pale,
    So that _unnethes_ upon his hors he sat."

            _The Millers Prologue_, v. 3123. [Tyrwhitt.]

And again:

    "Yeve me than of thy gold to make our cloistre,
    Quod he, for many a muscle and many an oistre,
    When other men han ben ful wel at ese
    Hath been our food, our cloistre for to rese:
    And yet, GOD wot, _unneth_ the fundament
    Parfourmed is, ne of our pauement
    N'is not a tile," &c.

                   _The Sompnours Tale_, v. 7685.

"Unneath," signifying _difficult_, _scarcely_, _with difficulty_, occurs
so frequently in Spenser, that it is unnecessary to burden your pages
with references. It may be remarked, however, that this latter author
occasionally employs this word in the sense of _almost_.

_Snail Gardens_ (Vol. viii., p. 33.).--In very many places on the

have collected much interesting information on this point, and shall feel
grateful for any farther "Notes" on the subject.

_Parvise_ (Vol. vii., p. 624.).--Perhaps the following quotation may
throw light on your correspondent D. P.'s inquiry respecting this word,
in French _Parvis_. It is taken from a _Dictionnaire Universel, contenant
généralement tous les mots françois, tant vieux que modernes, &c., par
feu Messire Antoine Furetière, Abbé de Chalivoi_, three vols. folio, La
Haye et la Rotterdam, 1701:

    "PARVIS, _s. m._--Place publique qui est ordinairement devant
    la principale face des grandes Eglises. Le parvis de Nôtre
    Dame, de Saint Généviève. On le disoit autrefois de toutes les
    places qui étoient devant les palais, et grandes maisons. Les
    auteurs Chrétiens appellent le _Parvis des Gentiles_, ce que
    les Juifs appelloient le _premier Temple_. Il y avoit deux
    _Parvis_ dans le Temple de Jérusalem; l'un intérieur, qui étoit
    celui des Prêtres; et l'autre extérieur, qu'on appelloit aussi
    le _Parvis d'Israël_, ou le _Grand Parvis_.--LE CL.

    "Quelques-uns disent que ce mot vient de _Paradisus_; d'autres
    de _parvisium_, qui est un lieu au bas de la nef où l'on tenoit
    autrefois les petites Ecoles, _à docendo parvis pueris_. Voyez
    Menage, qui rapporte plusieurs titres curieux en faveur de
    l'une et de l'autre opinion. D'autres le dérivent de _pervius_,
    disant qu'on appelloit autrefois _pervis_, une place publique
    devant un batiment."

T. H. DE H.

_Humbug_ (Vol. vii., p. 631.).--Allow me to add the following to the list
of explanations as to the origin of this word. There appeared in the
_Berwick Advertiser_ the following origin of the word _humbug_, and it
assuredly is a very feasible one. It may be proper to premise, that the
name of _bogue_ is commonly pronounced _bug_ in that district of Scotland
formerly called the "Mearns."

    "It is not generally known that this word, presently so much in
    vogue, is of Scottish origin. There was in olden time a race
    called Bogue, or Boag of that ilk, in Berwickshire. A daughter
    of the family married a son of Hume of Hume. In process of
    time, by default of male issue, the Bogue estate devolved on
    one Geordie Hume, who was called popularly 'Hume o' the Bogue,'
    or rather 'Aum o' the Bug.' This worthy was inclined to the
    marvellous, and had a vast inclination to exalt himself, his
    wife, family, brother, and all his ancestors on both sides. His
    tales however did not pass current; and at last, when any one
    made an extraordinary statement in the Mearns, the hearer would
    shrug up his shoulders, and style it just 'a hum o' the bug.'
    This was shortened into _hum-bug_, and the word soon spread
    like wildfire over the whole kingdom."

How far this is, or is not true, cannot be known; but it is certain that
the Lands of Bogue, commonly called by country folk "Bug," passed by
marriage into the Hume family; and that the male representatives of this
ancient family are still in existence. This much may be fairly asserted,
that the Berwickshire legend has more apparent probability about it than
any of the other ones.

J. MT.

P. S.--"That ilk," in old Scotch, means "the same:" in other words, Hume
of that ilk is just Hume of Hume; and Brodie of that ilk, Brodie of
Brodie.

_Table-moving_ (Vol. vii., p. 596.).--I imagine that the great object
in _table-moving_ is to produce the desired effect _without_ pressure.
During experiments I have often heard the would-be "table-movers" cry
"Don't press: it must be done without any pressure."

J. A. T.

_Scotch Newspapers_ (Vol. viii., p. 57.).--In Ruddiman's _Life_, by G.
Chalmers (8vo. Lond. 1794), it is stated that Cromwell was the first who
communicated the benefit of a newspaper to Scotland. {162} In 1652,
Christopher Higgins, a printer, whom Cromwell had conveyed with his army
to Leith, reprinted there what had been already published at London, _A
Diurnal of some passages and affairs for the information of the English
Soldiers_. A newspaper of Scottish manufacture appeared at Edinburgh, the
same authority relates, on the 31st of December, 1660, under the title of
_Mercurius Caledonius_; comprising the affairs in agitation in Scotland,
with a survey of foreign intelligence. It was published once a week, in a
small 4to. form of eight pages. Chalmers adds, that--

    "It was a son of the Bishop of Orkney, Thomas Lydserfe, who now
    thought he had the wit to amuse, the knowledge to instruct, and
    the address to captivate the lovers of news in Scotland. But he
    was only able, with all his powers, to extend his publication
    to ten numbers, which were very loyal, very illiterate, and
    very affected."

_Door-head Inscriptions_ (Vol. vii., pp. 23. 190. 588.; Vol. viii., p.
38.).--Over the door of the house at Salvington, Sussex, in which Selden
was born, is this inscription:

    "Gratvs, honeste, mihi; non clavdar, inito sedeq'
      Fvr, abeas; non sv' facta solvta tibi."

It has been thus paraphrased:

1. By the late William Hamper, Esq., _Gent. Mag._, 1824, vol. ii. p. 601.:

    "Thou'rt welcome, honest friend; walk in, make free:
    Thief, get thee gone; my doors are clos'd to thee."

2. By Dr. Evans:

    "An honest man is always welcome here;
    To rogues I grant no hospitable cheer."

3. In Evans's _Picture of Worthing_, p. 129.:

    "Dear to my heart, the honest here shall find
    The gate wide open, and the welcome kind;
    Hence, _thieves_, away! on you my door shall close,
    Within these walls the wicked ne'er repose."

4. In Shearsmith's _Worthing_, p. 71.:

    "The honest man shall find a welcome here,
    My gate wide open, and my heart sincere;
    Within these walls, for him I spend my store.
    But _thieves_, away! on you I close my door."

_Honorary Degrees_ (Vol. viii., pp. 8. 86.).--The short note of C. does
not elucidate--if, indeed, it touches upon--the matter propounded. It
was stated, whether correctly I know not, that honorary doctors created
by _diploma_ (reference being made to the Duke of Cambridge, and one or
two other royal personages) would have the _distinctive_ privilege of
voting in Convocation. It then occurred to me that Johnson--whose Oxford
dignity was conferred in 1776, by special requisition of the Chancellor,
Lord North (his M.A. degree had been, I judge, likewise by _diploma_)--is
not mentioned by Boswell or Croker, as having on any occasion exercised
the right referred to. Did he possess that right? and, if so, was it ever
exercised? The frequency of his visits to Oxford, and the alleged rigid
adherence to academical costume, make the question one of some interest:
besides, in regard to a person so entirely _sui generis_, and upon whose
character and career so much minuteness of biographical detail has been
bestowed, it is not a little remarkable how many points are almost barren
of illustration.

    "This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,

    cases, all kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in
    confined habit of body, as also diarrhœa, bowel complaints,
    affections of the kidneys and bladder, such as stone or gravel;
    inflammatory irritation and cramp of the urethra, cramp of

    result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints, where
    irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary
    and bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually

SOME ACCOUNT of DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE in ENGLAND, from the Conquest
to the end of the Thirteenth Century, with numerous Illustrations of
Existing Remains from Original Drawings. By T. HUDSON TURNER.

"What Horace Walpole attempted, and what Sir Charles Lock Eastlake has
done for oil-painting--elucidated its history and traced its progress
in England by means of the records of expenses and mandates of the
successive Sovereigns of the realm--Mr. Hudson Turner has now achieved
for Domestic Architecture in this country during the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries."--_Architect._

"The writer of the present volume ranks among the most intelligent of the
craft, and a careful perusal of its contents will convince the reader
of the enormous amount of labour bestowed on its minutest details,
as well as the discriminating judgment presiding over the general
arrangement."--_Morning Chronicle._

"The book of which the title is given above is one of the very few
attempts that have been made in this country to treat this interesting
subject in anything more than a superficial manner.

"Mr. Turner exhibits much learning and research, and he has consequently
laid before the reader much interesting information. It is a book that
was wanted, and that affords us some relief from the mass of works on
Ecclesiastical Architecture with which of late years we have been deluged.

"The work is well illustrated throughout with wood-engravings of the
more interesting remains, and will prove a valuable addition to the
antiquary's library."--_Literary Gazette._

"It is as a text-book on the social comforts and condition of the Squires
and Gentry of England during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that
the leading value of Mr. Turner's present publication will be found to
consist.

"Turner's handsomely-printed volume is profusely illustrated with careful
woodcuts of all important existing remains, made from drawings by Mr.
Blore and Mr. Twopeny."--_Athenæum._

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
