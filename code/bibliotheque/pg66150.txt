All that is related in thefollowing pages is associated with this corner of Canada. The name ofthe book comes from the newspaper in which most of the tales firstappeared. There is a purpose in the book. It attempts to convey ina readable form an idea of an era in the life of Canada which haspassed--that of its first settlement by emigrants from the Britishisles--and to give an account of two striking episodes in its history,the invasion under Hampton and the year of the ship fever. These arehistorically correct; the briefer tales are based on actual incidentsin the lives of early settlers in the old county of Huntingdon.CONTENTS.                                  PAGEHEMLOCK                              1ARCHANGE AND MARIE                 205THE SETTLER’S FIRST GRIST          225ABNER’S DEVICE                     236A SETTLER’S STORY                  254JEANIE MORISON                     290LOST                               318AN INCIDENT OF HUNTINGDON FAIR     324THE SUMMER OF SORROW               341NOTE                               459HEMLOCK.CHAPTER I.The rain of the forenoon had been followed by an outburst of heat andthe sunshine beat with fierce intensity on the narrow square thatformed the yard of the barracks at Montreal. There was a milkiness inthe atmosphere which, conjoined with the low bank of black cloud thathung over the St Lawrence where it rolled out of sight, indicated arenewal of the downpour. The yard was deserted. Dinner was over andthe men lounged and snoozed indoors until the sun abated his fervor,always excepting the sentry, who stood in the shade of the gateway,his gaze alternately wandering from the refreshing motion of the bluewaters of St Mary’s current to the cluster of log houses, interspersedby stone edifices with high tin roofs, which formed the Montreal of1813. Presently the sound of hoofs was heard, and there came gallopingto the gate an orderly from the general’s headquarters. Passing thesentry, he pulled up at the door of that portion of the barracks wherethe officer of the day was quartered, and who, in another minute, wasreading the despatch he had brought. It was an order for a detachmentof 20 men to report without delay at headquarters. Instantly the voiceof a sergeant was heard shouting the order to those who had to turnout and the barracks became a bustling scene of soldiers rubbing theiraccoutrements and packing their kits. In half an hour they had falleninto rank and marched to the general’s residence. The lieutenant incharge went in to report and found General de Watteville writing.“You ready for the route? Ah, yes; very good, Morton. I will write youone order. You will escort an ammunition-train to camp La Fourche andthere go under command of Major Stovin.”“I hope, General, there is a prospect of our helping to use thecartridges when we get there?”“I cannot say. Yankee very cautious; put his nose one, two, three timeacross the frontier and then run back, like rat to his hole. MaybeHampton come; we must be ready. Here is your order. You will find thetrain at King’s Posts and use all expedition.”Saluting the General, Morton withdrew and, rejoining his men, theymarched down the narrow and crooked maze of St Paul street, attractinglittle attention, for the sight of soldiers had become familiar even tothe habitant wives, who were jogging homeward in their market-carts.By the time the town was cleared, and the Lachine road gained, the sunwas inclining to the west, and his rays being more endurable, the menstepped out briskly, bandying coarse jests, while the officer, somepaces behind, eyed with surprised delight the foaming rapids, whichhe now saw for the first time. The afternoon was calm, which made thespectacle of a wide expanse of water tossed into huge billows withoutapparent cause, all the more singular. “Why,” said Morton inwardly,“all the rivers of the United Kingdom, with their falls and cataracts,if added to this vast river, would not perceptibly add either to itsvolume or its tumult.”At the head of the rapids, where the St Lawrence expands into the lakenamed St Louis, stood the King’s Posts, an extensive collection ofbuildings, with wharves in front, at which were moored a large numberof boats. King’s Posts was the depot of supplies for the countrywest of Montreal, and therefore a place of bustle in time of war,boats stemming the rapids and long trains of carts conveying to itsstorehouses daily the supplies brought by shipping from England toMontreal, to be in turn sent off as required to the numerous garrisonsalong the upper St Lawrence and lakes Ontario and Erie, while thetroops, then being hurried to the front, here embarked. Reportinghis command, Morton was informed the boat with the supplies he wasto guard would not be ready to sail until late in the evening, andquarters were assigned his men and to himself an invitation to jointhe mess-dinner. Thus relieved, he strolled to the water’s edge, andwatched the shouting boatmen and the swearing soldiers as they loadedthe flotilla that was in preparation, and was fortunate enough to seea bateau arrive from Montreal, poled up against the current by part ofits crew while the others tugged at a tow-rope, reinforced by a yoke ofoxen. Then he watched the sun, which, as it neared the horizon, dyedthe waters of the majestic river with many hues. Slowly it neared thethick battalion of pines behind which it would disappear, and as Mortonnoted the broad crimson pathway that it seemed to stretch across theplacid lake as a temptation to follow it into its chamber of glory, hethought he never beheld anything more imposing. Slowly the throbbingorb descended and was lost to sight, and, as if evoked by angel-spell,cloudlets became revealed and were transformed into plumage of scarletand gold. The train of Morton’s reverie was snapped by the tread oftroops behind him. Turning he saw a file of soldiers with a manacledman between them. When they reached the head of the wharf, the orderto halt was given. Morton knew what it meant. The tall thin man in hisshirt-sleeves was a spy and he was going to be shot. It was supper-timeand boats and wharfs were for the time no longer the scene of activity,but the grimy bateau-men paused in their cookery, to watch the tragedyabout to be enacted. Two soldiers lifted from their shoulders therough box that was to be his coffin, and the doomed man stood besideit. Behind him was the St Lawrence, a lake of molten glass; in frontthe line of soldiers who were to shoot him. There was no hurry orconfusion; everything being done in a calm and business-like manner.The prisoner stood undauntedly before his executioners; a man with asinister countenance, in which low cunning was mixed with imperturbableself-possession. He waved the bugler away when he approached to tie ahandkerchief over his eyes. “Guess I want ter hev the use o’ my eyes aslong as I ken; but say, kurnel, moughtn’t you loose my arms. It’s thelast wish of a dyin man.” The officer gave a sign with his hand, andthe rope was untied. “Prisoner, are you ready?”“Yes, kurnel.”Turning to the firing party, the officer gave the successiveorders--make ready,--present,--fire! Hardly had the last word beenuttered, than the prisoner, with surprising agility, gave a backwardleap into the river, and the volley swept over where he stood, thebullets ricochetting on the surface of the river behind. “The Yankeescoundrel! Has he escaped? Ten pounds for him alive or dead!” shoutedthe officer. There was a rush to the edge of the wharf, and thesoldiers fired at random amid its posts, but the American was not tobe seen. “It is impossible for him to escape,” the captain said toMorton, who had come to aid in the search. “He would have been hung hadwe had a gallows handy, and if he has escaped the bullet it is only tobe drowned, for the river runs here like a mill-race and will carry himinto the rapids.” The soldiers jumped on the boats and scanned wharfand shore, and seeing no trace came to the conclusion that from hisbackward leap he had been unable to recover himself and did not rise tothe surface. Satisfied the man was drowned, the soldiers were orderedback to the guard-room and the stir and hurry in getting the flotillaready were resumed.Soon afterwards Morton was seated at the mess-table, which was crowded,for there were detachments of two regiments on their way from Quebec,where they had landed the week before, to Upper Canada. The companywas a jovial one, composed of veteran campaigners who had learned tomake the most of life’s pleasures when they could be snatched, andjoke and story kept the table in a roar for a couple of hours, whenthe colonel’s servant whispered something in his ear. “Comrades,” hesaid, rising, “I am informed the boats are ready. The best of friendsmust part when duty calls, and the hour we have spent this eveningis a pleasant oasis in our long and toilsome journey through thiswilderness. We do not know what difficulties we may have to encounter,but we who braved the sun of India and stormed the Pyrenees will notfalter before the obstacles Canadian flood and forest may present, andwill carry the flag of our country to victory, as we have so oftendone under our glorious chief, Wellington. We come to cross swordsnot for conquest but to repel those invaders, who, professing to bethe champions of liberty, seek to bolster the falling cause of thetyrant of Europe by endeavoring to create a diversion in his favoron this western continent. We shall drive the boasters back, or elsewill leave our bones to be bleached by Canadian snows; and we shall domore, we shall vindicate the independence of this vast country againstthe ingrates who smite, in the hour of trial, the mother that rearedthem, and shall preserve Canada to be the home of untold millionswho will perpetuate on the banks of these great rivers and lakes theinstitutions and customs that have made the name of Britain renowned.Comrades, let us quit ourselves in this novel field of conflict asbefits our colors, and I propose, as our parting toast, Success to thedefenders of Canada, and confusion to the King’s enemies.”With clank of sword and sabre each officer sprang to his feet and thetoast was drank with shout and outstretched arm. Amid the outburst ofenthusiasm, a broad-shouldered captain started the chorus,     “Why, soldiers, why, should we be melancholy, boys?     Why, soldiers, why, whose business ’tis to die?”It was taken up with vigor until the roar was deafening, and thenthe colonel gave the signal to dismiss. From the heated room, Mortonstepped out and drew his breath at the spectacle presented. The moon,full orbed, hung over the woods of La-prairie and poured a flood oflight upon the rapids beneath, transforming them where shallow intolong lanes of glittering network and where the huge billows tossedin endless tumult, sable and silver alternated. Above, the watersslumbered in the soft light, unconscious of the ordeal towards whichthey were drifting and scarcely ruffled by the light east breeze thathad sprung up. Directly in front were the boats, loaded, and eachhaving its complement of soldiers. The officers took their placesamong them and they cast off, until over a hundred were engaged instemming the rapid current with aid of sail and oar. After passingbetween Caughnawaga and Lachine, indicated by their glancing spires,the leading boats awaited on the bosom of the lake for those that hadstill to overcome the river’s drift. When the last laggard had arrived,the flotilla was marshalled by the naval officers who had control intothree columns, some sixty yards apart, and, the oars being shipped, andsails hoisted, moved majestically for the head of the lake. Surely,thought Morton, as he eyed the imposing scene, the far-searching lakeembosomed by nodding forest, “This country is worth fighting for.”The air was balmy, the motion of the boats pleasant, the moonlightscene inspiring, so that the men forgot their fatigues, and burstinto song, and chorus after chorus, joined in by the entire flotilla,broke the silence. A piper, on his way to join his regiment, broke inat intervals and the colonel ordered the fife and drum corps to strikeup. The boat in which Morton sat brought up the rear, and softened bydistance and that inexpressible quality which a calm stretch of watergives to music, he thought he had never heard anything finer, and hecould not decide whether the singing of the men, the weird strainsof the pibroch, or the martial music of the fifes and drums was tobe preferred. About an hour had been spent thus, when the captainof the boat shouted to shift the sail, and putting up the helm, thelittle barque fell out of line and headed for an eminence on the southshore, so sharp and smooth in outline, that Morton took it to be afortification. When their leaving was noted, the men in the long linesof boats struck up Auld Lang Syne, the fifes and drums accompanying,and when they had done, the piper succeeded. Morton listened to thestrain as it came faintly from the fast receding flotilla, it was thatof Lochaber no More.As the shore was neared the boat was brought closer to the wind, andlying over somewhat deeply, the helmsman told those on the lee sideto change seats. In the movement a man rubbed against Morton, and hefelt that his clothes were wet. Looking sharply at him, he saw he wasone of the boat’s crew, when his resemblance to the spy he had seenescape the bullets of the firing-party struck him. The more he lookedthe more convinced he grew that he was correct, and, improbable asit seemed, within an arm’s length, almost, sat the man he saw plungeinto the river and whom he, with everybody else, believed to have beenswept into the deadly rapids. With all a soldier’s detestation of aspy, he resolved he should not escape, yet to attempt to seize himin the boat would be to imperil all in it, for that the fellow wouldmake a desperate struggle Morton knew. Prudently resolving to make nomove until the boat neared its moorings, he slipped his hand into hisbreast-pocket and grasped the stock of one of his pistols.As the boat approached the shore the sharply-cut eminence, whichMorton had taken to be a fortification, resolved itself into a grassyknoll, destitute of glacis or rampart, and round the eastern extremityof which they glided into a smooth narrow channel, whose margin wasfretted by the shadows cast by the trees which leant over from itsbanks. The sail now flapped uselessly and the order was given to getout the oars. The suspected spy rose with the other boatmen to get theminto place and stood on a cross-bench as he lifted a heavy oar to itslock. It was a mere pretence. In a moment his foot was on the gunwaleand he made a sudden spring towards the bank. There was the sound ofa plunge, of a few brief strokes by a strong swimmer, a movement amongthe bushes, and then silence. Morton was intensely excited, he drew hispistol, rose and cocking it fired at random. Turning to the captainof the boat he shouted in fury, “You villain; you have assisted inthe escape of a King’s prisoner.” With stolid countenance the captainshifted the helm to suit the windings of the channel, and answered,“Me no spik Ingleese.” Feeling he was powerless, Morton resumed hisseat and in a minute or two a cluster of white-washed huts came in viewand the boat drew alongside a landing-stage in front of them. Severalsoldiers were standing on it awaiting them, and on asking where hewould find the commissariat officer, Morton was directed to one of thehouses, in front of which paced a sentry. Entering he perceived itconsisted of two rooms, divided by a board-partition. In the larger endwas a woman, surrounded by several children, cooking at an open-fire,and in the other, the door and windows of which were open, for theevening was sultry, were four officers in dishabille, seated round arickety table playing cards, and with a pewter-measure in the middleof it. One of them rose on seeing the stranger, while the othersturned carelessly to examine him. Assuring himself he was addressingthe officer of the commissariat, Morton explained his business. “Oh,that’s all right; the powder-kegs must remain in the boat and in themorning I will get carts to forward them to the front. There’s anempty box, Lieutenant Morton; pull it up and join us,” and hospitablyhanded him the pewter-measure. It contained strong rum grog, of whicha mouthful sufficed Morton. Not so the others, who, in listening towhat he had to tell of the news of Montreal and of the movements ofthe troops, emptied it, and shouted to the woman to refill it, and, atthe same time, she brought in the supper, consisting of fried fish andpotatoes. That disposed of, the cards were reproduced and the four wereevidently bent on making a night of it. On returning from seeing howhis men were quartered, Morton found that the grog and the excitementof the card-playing were telling on his companions, who were noisy andquarrelsome. Asking where he should sleep, the woman pointed to theladder that reached to a trap in the roof, and he quietly ascended.It was merely a loft, with a small window in either gable and a fewbuffalo robes and blankets laid on its loose flooring. The place wasso stiflingly hot that Morton knew sleep was out of the question evenif there had been no noise beneath, and he seated himself by the sideof one of the windows through which the wind came in puffs. The skywas now partially clouded and the growl of distant thunder was heard.Fatigue told on the young soldier and he dozed as he sat. A crashof thunder awoke him. Startled he rose and was astonished to findhimself in utter darkness, save for the rays that came through thechinks of the flooring from the candle beneath, where the officerswere still carousing. He leant out of the window and saw that themoon had been blotted out by thick clouds. While gazing there was aflash of lightning, revealing to him a man crouched beside the windowbelow. In the brief instant of intense light, Morton recognized thespy, and guessed he was listening to the officers, hoping to pickup information, in their drunken talk, of use to his employers. “Hecheated the provost-marshal, he cheated me, but he shall not escapeagain,” muttered Morton, who drew his pistols, got them ready, and,grasping one in each hand, leant out of the window to await the nextflash that he might take aim. It came and instantly Morton fired. Theunsuspecting spy yelled, jumped to his feet, and rushed to the coverof the woods. Then all was darkness. A crash of thunder, the sweep ofthe coming hurricane and the pelting of rain, increased the futilityof attempting to follow. “I hope I’ve done for him,” said Morton tohimself, “and that like a stricken fox he will die in cover.”The pistol-shots together with the crash of the elements had put a stopto the carousal downstairs and Morton heard them disputing as to whoshould go up and see what had happened. “I will not go,” said one withthe deliberation of a stupidly drunk man. “I am an officer of the RoyalEngineers and have nothing to do with personal encounters. If you wanta line of circumvallation laid down, or the plan of a mine, I am ready,but my commission says nothing about fighting with swords or pistols. Iknow my office and how to maintain its dignity.”“Yes, Hughes, and the integrity of your skin. I’d go myself (here herose and tried to steady himself by holding on to the table) but I’llbe jiggered if I can go up such a stair-case as that. It would take ason of a sea-cook,” and with these words, losing his grip, the speakertoppled over and fell on the floor. The third officer, a mere lad,was asleep in his chair in a drunken stupor. The commissariat officerstaggered to the foot of the ladder, and, after vainly attempting toascend, shouted, “I say you there; what’s all the shooting for? Areyou such a greenhorn as to be firing at mosquitoes or a bullfrog. ByGeorge, when in company of gentlemen you should behave yourself. I willreport you to your shuperior officer,” and so he maundered on for awhile, receiving no answer from Morton. Finally the woman of the househelped him to a corner, where he lay down and snored away the fumes ofthe liquor that had overcome him. Meanwhile the storm raged, and whenit had passed away, and the moon again calmly came forth, and the frogsagain raised their chorus, Morton was too sleepy to think of going tolook for the body of the spy, and making as comfortable a bed as hecould, he lay down and rested until late next morning.CHAPTER II.On descending from his sleeping place, Morton found the woman preparingbreakfast, and, looking into the adjoining room, saw that three ofits inmates were still sleeping surrounded by the litter of theirnight’s carousal. Stepping out of doors, he was surprised by the beautyof the sylvan scene. The air had the freshness and the sky the deeptender-blue that follows a thunder-storm, and the sunshine glitteredon the smooth surface of the river that, in all its windings, wasoverhung by towering trees, except where small openings had been madeby the settlers, from which peeped their white shanties. The eminencewhich had excited his curiosity the night before, he perceived to bean island, with a largish house at its base, flanked by a wind-mill.At the landing, was the bateau, with a group of men. Approaching them,he found the captain, whose bloodshot eyes alone indicated his excessof the preceding night. “Ah, Morton,” he exclaimed, “you were the onlywise man among us; you have your wits about you this morning. For me,I had a few hours’ pleasure I now loathe to think of and a rackingheadache. Come, let us have a swim and then go to breakfast.”Following him to the nook he sought, Morton told of his shot at thespy. The captain listened attentively to the story. “I hope you wingedhim,” he said, “but he will escape. The settlers, except a few OldCountrymen, are all in sympathy with the Yankees, and will shelter andhelp him to get away. We cannot make a move that word is not sent tothe enemy. I will warn the Indians to look out for him. Had it not beenfor the rain, they could trace him to his lair.”On returning to the house, they found their comrades trying to makethemselves presentable and sat down to a breakfast of fried pork andsour bread, to which Morton did ample justice. The commissariat officertold him he could not start for some time, as carts were few and therain would have filled the holes in the track called a road. He couldhave forwarded him more quickly by canoes, but there was a risk ofwetting the powder at the rapids. It was noon before sufficient cartsarrived to enable Morton to start, when a laborious journey ensued,the soldiers being called on constantly to help the undaunted poniesto drag the cart-wheels out of the holes in which they got mired. Whenthey had gone a few miles the carts halted and the kegs were placedin boats, which conveyed them to their destination. Camp La Fourchewas found to consist of a few temporary buildings, or rather sheds,which, with the barns and shanties of the settlers near by, housed afew hundred men, of whom few were regulars. Morton’s orders were toremain and time passed heavily, the only excitement being when a scoutcame in with reports of the movements of the American army on thefrontier, which were generally exaggerated. The camp had been purposelyplaced at the forks of the English and Chateaugay rivers, to afforda base of operations against the invader, should he approach eitherby way of the town of Champlain or of Chateaugay. Morton relieved thetedium of waiting by hunting and fishing, for his proper duties wereslight. At first he did not venture into the woods without a guide,but experience quickly taught one so active and keen of observationsufficient bush-lore to venture alone with his pocket-compass. Thefishing, at that late season, was only tolerable, and while he enjoyedto the full the delight of skimming the glassy stretches of both riversin a birch canoe, he preferred the more active motion and greatervariety of traversing the pathless woods with his gun. He had been incamp over a week when he started for an afternoon’s exploring of thewoods. After an hour’s tramp he struck the trail of what he believedto be a bear. Following it was such pleasant exercise of his ingenuitythat he took no note of time, and he had traversed miles of swamp andridge before prudence cried halt. The sun was sinking fast, and toretrace his track was out of the question. He resolved to strike duenorth, which he knew would take him to the Chateaugay where he wouldfind shelter for the night. The flush of the sunset was dying fromthe sky when he emerged from the woods on the banks of the river,which flowed dark and silent between the endless array of trees whichsentinelled it on either side. Threading his way downward he, in time,came upon a clearing--a gap in the bush filled with ripening grain andtasselled corn. The shanty, a very humble one, stood at the top of thebank, with the river at its feet. Gratified at the prospect of rest, hepaused before swinging himself over the rude fence. There rose in theevening air the sound of singing: it was a psalm-tune. The family wereat worship. Reverently the soldier uncovered his head and listened.The psalm ended, he could hear the voice of supplication, though notthe words. When Morton approached the house he saw a heavily-built manleave the door to meet him.“Gude e’en, freen; ye’re oot late. But I see ye’re are o’ the militaryand your wark caas ye at a’ hoors. Is there ony news o’ the Yankeearmy?”Morton explained he had not been on duty but had got belated in huntingand craved the boon of shelter until morning, for which he would pay.“Pay! say ye. A dog wearing the King’s colors wad be welcome to mybest. You maun be new to this country to think the poorest settler init wad grudge to share his bite with ony passerby. Come your ways; weare richt glad to see you.”Entering the shanty Morton was astounded at the contrast between thehomelike tidiness of the interior and the rudeness of the exterior,everything being neatly arranged and of spotless cleanliness. “Truly,”he thought, “it is not abundance that makes comfort, but the taste andingenuity to make the best of what we have.” The glow of the log-firein the open chimney was supplemented by the faint light afforded by acandle made from deer-fat, which showed him a tall young woman, whocame forward to shake hands without the slightest embarrassment, anelderly woman, evidently the mother, who kept her seat by the fire,explaining she “wasna very weel,” and two stout young men.“Sit in by the fire, Mr Morton; there is a snell touch in the eveningair that makes it no unpleasant, and Maggie will get ye something toeat. An hae ye nae news frae the lines? Does it no beat a’ that thaeYankees, wha mak such pretensions to be the only folk i’ the warld whaunderstan what liberty is, should fail in practice? What hae we donethat they shud come in tae disturb us? Hae we nae richt to live doucelyand quietly under our appointed ruler, that they should come into ourain country to harry and maybe kill us? Dod, they are a bonny lot! Inthe name o’ freedom drawing the sword to help the oppressor of Europeand the slaughterer of thousands of God’s children by creation, if noby adoption.”“We have the comfort,” replied Morton, “that they have not got Canadayet.”“An never will,” replied the settler, “there’s no an Auld Countrymanon the Chateaugay wha wad na sooner tint life an a’ than gie up hisindependence. My sons an mysel are enrolled in Captain Ogilvie’scompany and mair Yankees than they count on will hansel it’s groundafore they win oor puir biggin.”“Dinna speak sae, gudeman,” said his wife, “tho’ the Lord may chastisehe will not deliver us to the oppressor, but, as with the Assyrian,will cause him, gin he come doon on us, to hear a rumor that shall makehim to return to his own land. We are but a feeble folk here by theriver-side, but He winna fail them wha trust Him.”Maggie here beckoned the young officer to draw to the table, and thebread and milk tasted all the sweeter to him that they had been spreadby so winsome a damsel. After supper Morton was glad to fall in withthe family’s custom of going early to bed, and accompanying the lads,whom he found to be frank, hearty fellows, to the outbuilding, sleptcomfortably alongside them on top of the fragrant fodder. At daylightthey were astir, when their guest joined them in their labors, untila shout from Maggie told of breakfast being ready. Seen by daylightthe favorable impression made upon Morton the previous evening wasdeepened, and he did not know which most to admire, her tact whichnever placed her at a disadvantage or the deftness with which shedischarged her household duties. Reluctantly he left, accepting readilythe invitation to revisit them. In a couple of hours he was in camp andreported himself.The acquaintance thus accidentally formed was cultivated by Morton,and few evenings passed that his canoe did not end its journey at thefoot of the bank whence the settler’s shanty overlooked the Chateaugay.The more he knew of the family the more he was attracted, and beforelong he was on familiar terms with all its members. The inaction ofcamp-life in the backwoods ceased to be wearisome and there was a glowand a joyousness in his days which he had never before known. So itcame, that when, one afternoon, the orderly-sergeant notified him theofficer in command desired to see him, the prospect of being sent awaycaused him a pang of vexation. His orders were to be ready to startat daylight for the frontier with despatches for the Indian guardand to collect what information he could with regard to the Americanarmy encamped at Four Corners. “I trust to your discretion,” said theofficer, “as to what means you will use to get it, but we want toknow the extent of the force and the prospect of their moving. I willgive you an Indian as a guide, and one who speaks English.” Mortonwithdrew, pleased that the order was not one of recall to his regimentat Montreal, and spent the evening with the Forsyths. The news of hisdeparture, on an errand that involved some danger, even though it wouldlast only a few days, dampened the innocent mirth of the household andthe soldier was vain enough to think Maggie gave his hand a warmerpressure than usual when he left. He rose with the first streak ofdaylight and had finished his breakfast when he was told his guidewas waiting. Hastily strapping his cloak on his back and snatching uphis musket, he went out and beheld an Indian standing stolidly on theroad. Morton noted that he was taller than the average of his race,and, despite his grizzled hair, gave every sign of unabated vigor. Hewas dressed in native fashion and his face was hideous with war-paint.Without uttering a word, he led the way and they were soon buried inthe woods. The Indian’s pace, considering the nature of the groundand the obstacles presented, was marvellously rapid, and induced nofatigue. Morton vigorously exerted himself to keep up with him and, ashe did so, admired the deftness with which the Indian passed obstacleswhich he laboriously overcame. The ease and smoothness with whichthe red man silently slipped through thickets and fallen trees, hecompared to the motion of a fish, and his own awkwardness to that of ablindfolded man, who stumbled at every obstacle. They had travelledthus for over two hours when suddenly the Indian halted, peeredcarefully forward, and then signed to Morton to stand still. Falling onhis knees the guide crept, or rather glided forward. Disregarding hissign, Morton shortly followed until the object of the Indian’s questcame in sight. Three deer were grazing on a natural meadow by the sideof a creek. Slowly the hunter raised his gun and its report was thefirst intimation the timid creatures had that an enemy was near. Theyoungest and plumpest had fallen; the others bounded into the bush.Standing over the graceful creature, whose sides still palpitated, theIndian said, “Lift.” It was the first word he had uttered. Morton drewthe four hoofs together and did so. “Put on your shoulder,” added theguide. Morton laughed and set the animal down; he could lift it but tocarry it was out of the question. Without moving a feature, the Indiangrasped the deer by its legs, swung it round his neck, and stepped outas if the load were no burden, and which he bore until the swamp waspassed and a ridge was reached, when he tied the hoofs together with awithe and swung the carcase from as lofty a branch as he could reach.Half an hour afterwards he pointed to a slight disturbance in thelitter of the forest. “Indian passed here this morning.”“How do you know it was an Indian?”“By mark of moccasin.”“But some white men wear moccasins.”“Yes, but white man steps differently. The wild duck flies no more likethe tame duck than the Indian walks like the pale face.”Following the trail thus struck, they were soon hailed by a scout andin the midst of the camp of the frontier guard they sought. Mortoncounted seventeen Indians lounging or sleeping about the fire, and wastold there were as many more lurking in the bush, watching the enemy,who had, of late, been sending in strong parties to make petty raidsupon the few settlers who lived on the Canadian side of the boundary.As the captain was absent and would not be back until the afternoon,Morton could only await his return, and the rest was not unwelcome, forthe rapid journey had induced some fatigue, and he was interested inwatching the Indians, this being his first experience with them apartfrom white men. They paid much deference to his guide, whose name henow learned was Hemlock, and the Indian of whom he made enquiry toldhim the reason was that he was the son of a great sachem in a tribe nowdestroyed, and was “a big medicine.” Hemlock accepted their tributesto his superiority with unmoved countenance and as a matter of course,until, after a long pow-wow, he stretched himself on the ground,face-downwards, and went to sleep. Associating the Indians with gloomymoroseness, and a stolidity insensible alike to pain or mirth, Mortonwas surprised to see how, when left to themselves, they chatteredlike children, laughed, and played boyish tricks upon one another, andregretted he could not understand what they were saying. If he had, hewould have found their talk was the shallowest of banter.Late in the afternoon the captain returned and warmly welcomed Morton.Although dressed like an Indian, his only distinguishing feature beinga captain’s scarlet sash, Captain Perrigo was a white man and Englishin speech, his familiarity with the Indians and their language havingbeen acquired during his residence at Caughnawaga. He was thoroughlyconversant with all that was passing in the American camp and expressedhis belief that only the timidity of General Hampton prevented a moveon Canada. The force was so strong and well-equipped that he believedit could not be checked until the island of Montreal was reached. “Howcan so large an army move through these woods?” asked Morton; “why,even your handful of Indians could cut up a regiment in half an hour.”“You forget,” replied Perrigo, “that the larger part of these Americansoldiers have been reared on farms and are familiar with the bush.They are at home with the axe, and have scouts as well-trained tobush-fighting as our own. Worse than that, many of the Americansettlers who left the Chateaugay and the other Huntingdon settlementsat the declaration of war are with them as guides.”“I should like to see the American army,” said Morton.“That is easy; we reconnoitre their camp this evening and you may gowith us.”By this time dinner was ready and it was more appetizing than Mortonlooked for. Hemlock, on his arrival, had told where he had left thecarcase of the deer, which two of the Indians went for and returnedwith it slung between them on a pole. This they had cooked along withpieces of fat pork. The venison, for a wonder, proved to be tender andsucculent, and was eaten with biscuit, of which there was an abundance.When the time came to move, Perrigo gave the word, when 28 of his menfell into line, Hemlock and Morton accompanying them. They moved insilence in single file, the fleetest runner of their number leadingabout two hundred yards ahead, to see that the way was clear. No wordwas spoken except when, on gaining the summit of a stony knoll, Perrigowhispered to Morton that they had crossed the boundary and were in theUnited States. As they proceeded they moved more slowly, showing theywere nearing the enemy, and twice their scout signalled to them tohalt while he reconnoitred. The second time Perrigo went forward andthey waited while he scanned the enemy’s position. On returning, theymoved westward, when the accustomed sound of the tramp of a numerousbody of troops met the ear of Morton, followed by the commands of theadjutant. Motioning to Morton to follow him, Perrigo cautiously creptforward to a clump of undergrowth, and peering through it the Americancamp was seen. To the right stood the cluster of wooden buildings whichformed the village of Four Corners, and on the fields that sloped upfrom it southwards, shone peacefully in the setting sun long rows ofwhite tents. On a small field between the camp and the village tworegiments were being drilled; at one corner was a body of mountedofficers observing them. The woods, in which the British party layconcealed, so closely hemmed in the thin line of buildings that formedthe village, that the parade-ground was not over 300 yards distant.Morton scanned the troops as they went through their evolutions andmarked, with some complacency, that, although tall and wiry men, theywere slouchy in their movements and marched like dock-laborers. “Couldwe not give those fellows a fright?” he whispered to Perrigo.“If we were sure their patrols are not out we could. If they are, theymight flank us.”“No danger,” interposed Hemlock, “see!” and he pointed to theguard-house, where the men detailed for the night’s patrols werewaiting.“All right,” answered Perrigo, “I will send two or three to creep roundto the bush on the right to cause a diversion.”“Stay,” said Morton, “I want to get a closer view and Hemlock will gowith me.”It was so decided upon, and while they picked their way to the west,Perrigo busied himself in extending his little force along the edgeof the woods, so as to make their numbers appear formidable. Themost dangerous part of Morton’s movement was crossing two roads, butHemlock, who knew the ground thoroughly, selected parts where therewere bends, so that they could not be seen by travellers approachingeither way. When Hemlock dropped on all fours and crept he was followedby Morton, who found he was at the edge of the field on which the drillwas in progress. The troops had gone through the routine movements andwere drawn up in line, awaiting the inspection of the general officer,who, with his escort, was riding from the lower part of the field. Astout, elderly man rode in advance on a splendid black horse. Hemlockwhispered it was General Hampton. As they drew nearer Morton started inamaze, for among his staff, despite his handsome uniform, he recognizedthe countenance of the spy he had twice shot at. His astonishment waschecked by a gurgling sound of anger from his companion, and turning hesaw that Hemlock had partly risen, grasping his musket as if about tofire, his face so swollen with rage that the cords of the neck stoodout. “Stop,” said Morton, as he clutched his buckskin jacket, “ifwe fire now while they are in rank we are lost; wait until they aredismissed and in disorder.”“I care not; thrice have I missed him of late; now he falls andHemlock is revenged.” He pulled the trigger, but the flint snappedharmlessly, for the priming had been lost. The disappointment restoredhis self-possession and he drew back with a scowl that made Morton’sflesh creep. On the cavalcade of officers came, chatting unconcernedly,and wheeled within twenty yards of where Morton stood. He had a goodview of the spy’s face, and he thought he had never seen one wherecunning and selfishness were so strongly marked. “A man who would killhis mother if she stood in his way,” muttered Morton. “And for hispassing pleasure tear out the heart of a father,” added Hemlock in abitter tone. They noticed how haughtily Gen. Hampton bore himself andhow superciliously he glanced at the men as he passed up and down theirranks. When he had finished, he put spurs to his horse and gallopedtowards the house in the village where his quarters were established,followed by his escort. The troops were then dismissed and as eachcompany filed away in the early twilight towards its respective camp,Morton said “Now is our time.” Hemlock rose, drew himself to his fullheight, seemed for a few seconds to be gathering strength, and then letout a screech, so piercing and terrific that Morton, who had not beforeheard the war-whoop, would not have believed a human being could makesuch a sound. It was the signal to Perrigo’s men, and they answeredfrom different parts of the bush in similar fashion. The Americansoldiers, on their way to their tents, halted in amaze, while fromnew and unexpected quarters, rose the blood-curdling yell, giving theimpression that they were being surrounded from the north and west bya horde of Indians, a foe of whom they were in mortal dread. Taken bysurprise, they broke and ran towards the camp, and Morton could seethe inmates of the tents swarming out and running to meet them, as ifto find out the cause of alarm. Hemlock and Morton were now loadingand firing as quickly as they could, the former never intermitting hisear-piercing shrieks, while the edge of the bush to their left wasdotted with puffs of smoke from the guns of Perrigo’s band. “O forfive hundred more!” cried Morton in his excitement, “and we would routthis army of cowards.” The confusion and clamor in the camp increasedand the contradictory orders of officers were paid no heed to by menwho only wanted to know where they could fly to escape the detestedIndians. Amid the excitement rang out a bugle, and turning whence thesound came, Morton saw it was from the General’s headquarters andthat, to its summons, horsemen were urging their way. “Huh!” exclaimedHemlock, “these are scouts; some of them Indians. We must go, for theywill hold the roads.” With a final yell he plunged into the bush andMorton followed. They had not gone far when Hemlock turned and graspedhis shoulder. As they stood, the hoofs of advancing horses were heard.The sound came nearer and Morton guessed they were riding along theeast and west road in front of where he stood and which they had beenabout to cross. The troop swept past and then the order “Halt!” wasshouted. “Louis, take five men and scour the bush from the river upuntil you hear from the party who are searching the bush from above.The screeching devils who hid here cannot escape between you. We willpatrol the road and shoot them if they do.” The motion of the menordered to dismount was heard.“Quick,” whispered Hemlock, “or they will be upon us,” and facingwestward he led to the brink of what seemed to be a precipice, from thefoot of which rose the sound of rushing water. Hemlock slipped his guninto his belt in front of him and did the same with Morton’s, then,before he knew what was meant, Morton was grasped in his iron clutch,unable to move, his head tucked into his breast, and with a wild flingover the edge of the bank they went rolling and crashing downwards,through the bushes and shrubs that faced it. On they rolled until afinal bounce threw them into a pool of the river. Without a moment’sdelay, Hemlock caught Morton’s right arm and dragged him a considerabledistance down the narrow and shallow stream behind a clump of bushes.Breathless and excited by the rapid motion, Morton sank prone on theturf, while Hemlock, laying aside the guns, which the water hadrendered useless, drew his tomahawk, which he held ready for use, whilehe bent forward listening intently. In a few minutes Morton becameconscious of men stealthily approaching, and devoutly thanked God whenhe perceived they were all on the other side of the river from wherethey were concealed. On they came, searching every place of possibleconcealment, with a rapidity that only children of the woods canattain. Soon they were directly opposite and passed on. Hemlock relaxedhis strained attitude, drew a long breath, and sat down beside Morton.“They did not think we had time to cross the river, but when they donot find us they will come back on this side.”“What shall we do next?” asked Morton.“Wait till it is dark enough to creep across the road at the bridge.”“And if they come back before then?”“Fight them,” abruptly answered Hemlock.In the narrow gorge where they lay the gloom quickly gathered, andit soon grew so dark that Morton’s fears as to the searching-partyreturning were relieved. When the last streak of day had disappeared,Hemlock led the way, and they crept as quickly as the nature of theground would permit down the river, whose noisy brawl blotted out thesound they made.Coming out at a pond, where the water had been dammed to drive a smallmill, Hemlock stopped and listened. The road with its bridge wasdirectly in front, and it was likely guards were there posted. As theywatched, the door of a house opened, and a man came out with a lantern.It was the miller going to the mill. As he swung the light its beamsshone along the road, failing to reveal a sentinel. When he passed intothe mill, Hemlock led the way under the shade of the trees that fringedthe mill-pond, crossed the road, and down into the rocky bed of thestream on the other side. Pausing to let Morton gain his breath afterthe run, he said in his ear, “We are safe now and can wait for themoon.”“Can’t we rejoin Perrigo?” asked Morton.“No; scouts in woods over there; hide tonight and go back tomorrow.”The strain of excitement over, Morton stretched himself on the fernsthat abounded and quickly fell asleep.CHAPTER III.When Morton opened his eyes he found the dell, or rather gorge, forthe sides were almost precipitous though clad with vegetation, waslit up by the moon, and Hemlock by his side, sitting Indian fashion,clasping his knees. Without uttering a word, he rose on perceiving theyoung officer was awake and lifted his gun to move on. Morton obeyedthe mute sign and they began to descend the bed of the stream. It wasa task of some difficulty, for it abounded in rocks and often therewas no foothold at the sides, the water laving the cliffs that formedthe banks. Had it not been that the season was an unusually dry one,leaving the river bed largely bare, Morton could not have kept up withhis companion. Chilled by his wet garments, the exercise was rathergrateful to him and he exerted himself to overcome the obstacles in hispath. As they went on, the banks grew higher and the gorge more narrow,until, turning a bend, Morton perceived the river dashed down a channelcleft out of a rock, which rose a pillared wall on one side and onthe other had been rendered concave by the washing down of the debrisof ages. High above, shafts of moonlight struggled thru’ the foliageand, falling irregularly on the sides, brought into ghastly relief thenakedness of the walls of the rocky prison. Deeply impressed Mortonfollowed his guide down the gloomy chasm, whence the sound of fallingwater came, and they passed two small falls. Below the lower one,where the walls drew nearer, as if they grudged the scanty space theyhad been affording the tumultuous stream for its passage, the cliffsgrew loftier. Hemlock halted, and pointing to a water-worn recess inthe rocks, that afforded some covering, said, “Sleep there.” Mortonlay down, but he was in no humor to sleep again. The magnificence ofthe rock-hewn chamber in which he lay, with a giant cliff bendingover him, had excited his imagination, and his eyes wandered from thefoaming falls in front of him to the solemn heights, whose walls wereflecked with shrubs and topped by spruce trees. The contrast of theunceasing noise and motion of the river with the eternal silence andimperturbability of the rocks, deeply impressed him. Thus time passedand when he had scanned the scene to his satisfaction, his interestturned to his companion, who had left him and stood beneath a pillarof rock higher than its fellows, where the chasm narrowed into a meretunnel. Evidently supposing that Morton was sound asleep, he was goingthrough those motions of incantation by which Indian medicine-menprofess to evoke the spirits. He writhed until his contortions werehorrible, while the working of his features showed he was inwardlystriving to induce an exalted and morbid condition of feeling. He smotehis breast resounding blows, he flung himself downwards on the rockand shook himself until his body jerked with involuntary twitchings,he shrieked in hollow tones and plucked at his hair, until the sweatrolled down his cheeks. After a fit of hysterical laughter he sank in aswoon, which lasted so long that Morton was debating whether he shouldnot go over to him. All this time the moon had been sailing upward andnow stood directly over the chasm, its beams transforming the foamingriver into a channel of milky whiteness and, where it broke into curlsat the falls, into streams of pearls, while the foliage that temperedthe stern outline of the rocks, bedewed by the spray that kept themconstantly moist, glistened as if sprinkled with diamond-dust. Themoonlight streamed on the prostrate body of the Indian, and as he awokefrom his trance and slowly raised himself, Morton read in his face awonderful change--a look of calmness and of supernatural ecstasy. Withgreat dignity he drew himself up and stepped forward a few paces untilhe stood directly beneath the pillar of rock. Then he spoke: “Spiritof the wood and stream, who loves this best of all thine abodes, cometo me. Hemlock seeks thee to help him. The wounded moose will neverbreathe again the morning-air, the stricken pine-tree never put forthfresh shoots, and Hemlock is wounded and stricken and growing old.Shall the hand grow feeble before the blow is dealt, the eye growdim before mine enemy is slain, and my ear grow deaf before it hearshis death-groan? The leaves that fall rot and the water that passethreturneth not; therefore, oh Spirit, grant to Hemlock his prayer, thatbefore night comes he may find whom he seeks. Again, this day, has heescaped me, shielded by his medicine. Break the spell, O Spirit; takeaway the charm that holds my arm when I aim the blow, and pluck awaythe shield the evil ones hold over him! The eagle has his nest on thehill and the fox his lair in the valley, but Hemlock has no home. Thedoe fondles its fawn and the tired swallow is helped across the greatwater on the wings of its sons, but Hemlock has no children. The lightof his eyes was taken from him, the joy of his heart was frozen. TheYankee stole his land, slew his brothers, bewitched his only daughter,and drove him away, and now he is a sick-struck man, whom none comenear. Spirit, grant the prayer of Hemlock; break the spell that bindsme, that I may taste the blood of mine enemy and I shall die happy.”He paused and assumed a listening attitude as if awaiting an answer.That in his morbid state of mind he fancied he heard the Spirit inreply was evident, for he broke out again:“I am desolate; my heart is very bitter. The smoke of the wigwams of myclan rises no more; I alone am left. When the north wind tells whereare the leaves of last summer I will say where are the warriors of mytribe. As the beaver the white man came among us, but he crushed uslike the bear; the serpent sings on the rock but he bites in the grass.We were deceived and robbed of the lands of our fathers. Our destroyeris near, he is on the war-path, his hatchet is raised against the GreatFather. Blind his eyes, trip his feet with magic, O Oki, and take thespell from the arm of Hemlock. The eagle soars to the mountain whenthe loon keeps to the valley; the snow-bird breasts the storm when themoose seeks the cedar-brake: the wolf knows no master and the catamountwill not fly, so the Indian clings to his hunting-ground and will notbe the slave of the stranger. Spirit, help to destroy the destroyer andto rob the robber. The hunted deer dies of his wounds in the strangeforest. The arrows of the Indian are nigh spent and he mourns alone.The glory of our nation has faded as the fire of the forest in themorning-sun, and few live to take revenge. Oki, speak, and strengthenthe heart of Hemlock for battle!”The Indian fell prostrate before the gaunt pillar of stone to which hespoke and lay there for some time. When he rose, there was a weary lookin his impassive features. “The Spirit has spoken: he tells Hemlock hewill answer him in a dream.” Advancing towards Morton he lay down andfell asleep.High above him shafts of sunlight were interwoven with the foliageof the trees that overhung the crest of the chasm, forming a radiantceiling, when Morton awoke. The weirdly romantic gulf in which he lay,coupled with the strange scenes of the night, caused him to think thepast was a dream, but going over the several details the sense ofreality was restored, and there, a few feet from him, was stretched thesinewy form of the Indian. “Who could fancy that a being so stolid,heavy, and matter-of-fact,” asked Morton of himself, “should show suchkeenness of feeling and so active an imagination? And, yet, how littlewe know of what sleeps in the bosoms of our fellows. Mark that sullenpool above the cataract! How dead and commonplace its water appears.It is swept over the brink and, breaking into a hundred new forms,instantly reveals there dwelt dormant beneath its placid surface a lifeand a beauty undreamt of. We are not all as we seem, and so with thismuch-tried son of the forest.”He rose to bathe his stiffened limbs in the river and the motion causedHemlock to spring to his feet. He glanced at the sky, and remarked thathe had slept too long. While Morton bathed, Hemlock busied himselfin contriving a scoop of withes and birch bark, with which, standingbeneath the fall, he quickly tossed out a number of trout. A flintsupplied fire and on the embers the fish as caught were laid to roast,and whether it was so, or was due to his keen appetite, Morton thoughtthey tasted sweeter than when cleaned. With the biscuit in theirpouches, though wet, they made a fair breakfast. As they finished,a faint echo of drums and fifes was wafted to them. “We will stay alittle while,” said Hemlock, “to let the scouts go back to camp, forthey would search the woods again this morning.”“And what then?” asked Morton.“We will go back to Perrigo, who is near-by.”“Would they not fly to Canada after what they did?”“Indians are like the snake. When it is hunted, it does not fly; ithides. They are waiting for us.”“Where were you taught to speak English so well, Hemlock?”“I did not need to be taught; I learnt it with the Iroquois. I was bornnear an English settlement and my choice companion was an English girl,we played together, and were taught together by the missionary; longafter, she became my wife.”“But you are not a Christian?”“No; when I saw the white man’s ways I wanted not his religion.”“And your wife, is she living?”“Hemlock does not lay his heart open to the stranger; he is alone inthe world.”Respecting his reserve, and tho’ curious to know if the guardian-spiritof the chasm had spoken to him in his dreams, Morton changed thesubject, the more so as he did not wish his companion to know thathe had been the unwitting witness of his invocation ceremonial. Heasked about the chasm in whose solemn depths they found shelter, andHemlock told how it had been known to all the seven nations of theIroquois and regarded by them as a chosen abode of the spirits, themore so as its origin was supernatural. There had been a very rainyseason and the beavers had their villages flooded and were in dangerof being destroyed. Two of them volunteered to visit the spirit-landand beseech the help of their oki, which he promised. He came one darknight and with a single flap of his tail smote the rock, splitting itin two and allowing the waters to drain into the low country beneath.Morton listened gravely, seeing his companion spoke in all seriousness,and thought the tale might be an Indian version of the earthquake, orother convulsion of nature, by which the bed of sandstone had beenrent asunder, and a channel thus afforded for the surplus waters ofthe adjoining heights. The trees and bushes which had found an airyfoothold in crevices, and the weather-beaten and lichened faces of thecliffs, told how remote that time must have been.It was wearing on to noon before Hemlock considered it safe to move.The delay they spent in cleaning their arms, and Morton, to hisregret, found that his powder was useless from being wet. The Indian,more provident, had saved some in a water-proof pouch of otter skin,but he had too little to do more than lend a single charge for his gun.Morton took the opportunity to clean and arrange his uniform as he bestcould and when ready to move felt he looked more as became an officerof the King’s army than when he awoke. Hemlock led the way to where acleft in the wall of rocks afforded a possibility of ascent, and, withthe occasional aid of his outstretched arm, Morton managed to reach thesummit. When he had, he perceived he stood on a plain of table-rock,the cleavage of which formed the chasm, of whose existence the explorercould have no intimation until he reached its brink. They had not gonefar, until Hemlock halted and looked intently at the ground. “A partyof Yankees have passed here within an hour; a dozen or more of them.See the trail of their muskets!”“How do you know they have just passed?”“The dew has not been dry here over an hour and they passed when it wasgone. They are searching for us, for one went to that bush there to seeno one was hiding.”Morton looked perplexed, for nothing was more distasteful than to betaken prisoner. “Had we not,” he suggested, “better return to the chasmand wait for night?”“It is too late,” replied Hemlock, “when they come back they would seeour trail and follow it. We will have to go on and if we get acrossthe road we are safe,” and without another word he went on until theroad was reached. On scanning it, before making a dash across, theyperceived, to their dismay, a mounted sentry so posted as to give aclear view of the portion of the road they were standing by. Hemlockgave a grunt of disappointment and returned into the bush and aftera few minutes’ rapid walking turned to Morton with the words, “Youstay here, until I go and see the road. Over there is the track of ashort-cut between Four Corners and the blockhouse, so if Yankees passthey will keep to it and not see you. Do not leave until I come back.”Morton threw himself on the grass to await his report, and the restwas grateful, for the day was hot and their short tramp fast. Theminutes sped without sign of the Indian, who he conjectured was findingit difficult to discover a clear passage. It was now plain that theAmericans had discovered their tracks of the preceding evening andhad established a cordon to ensure their capture. So absolute wasMorton’s faith in Hemlock’s skill that he felt little perturbed andwas confident they would be in Perrigo’s camp before long. Then histhoughts wandered to a subject that had come of late to be pleasant tohim, to the household by the Chateaugay, and he saw in fancy Maggiebustling about her daily tasks, and he smiled.“In the name of the United States of America I command you to yield asprisoner,” shouted a voice with a nasal twang.Morton bounded to his feet. In front of him, within four yards, stoodthe spy, holding a musket, with his finger on the trigger.“I mout hev shot ye dead a-laying there,” he said, “but I mean to takegame like you alive. I can make more out o’ your skin when you can wagyer tongue. Yield peaceable, young man, and giv up yer arms.”“Yield! And to a spy! Never!” shouted Morton indignantly, and he spranglike a panther at his foe. Quick as was his movement, the Americanwas not quite taken by surprise, for he fired, but the bullet missed.The next moment Morton was on him and they grappled. Both were strongmen, but the American was older and had better staying power, and asthey wrestled Morton felt he would be thrown, when he bethought him ofa certain trip he had often used successfully in his school days. Hemade the feint, put out his foot, and the American fell with a crash,underneath him.“Villain,” he whispered hoarsely, “you twice escaped me, but will notagain,” and he grasped his throat with one hand while he held his rightarm with the other.“Quarter,” gasped the American, who was in danger of being choked, “Iyield.”“Quarter to a spy!” exclaimed Morton.“I ain’t no spy. I’m Major Slocum, brevet-rank, of Ginral Hampton’sstaff.”“Not a spy! You were to have been shot for one.”“I was on special service, when I was informed on by an ongratefulcuss. I’m an honorable officer and appeal to yer honor as a Britisher.Take my sword; I yield your prisoner.”“If I let you go; will you lead me in safety across your lines, andrelease my guide Hemlock, if he has been taken prisoner?”“Sartainly I will; Slocum’s word is as good as his bond. Take yourhands off me and I will set you and your Injun to hum in an hour.”Morton released his grasp, and stood up, drew his sword, and awaitedSlocum’s rising. With a deft movement the American thrust his handinto his belt, drew a heavy, short-bladed knife, and shot it forwardfrom his palm with an ease and dexterity that indicated much practice.Morton’s eye caught the gleam of the steel and he sprang back, andin so doing saved his life, for the point of the blade, which wouldhave pierced his breast, stuck in his right thigh for an instantand dropped out. In a towering passion of indignation, which madehim unconscious of the pain and flow of blood, he rushed upon theAmerican, who had sprung to his feet and lifted his sword in time tofoil Morton’s thrust. “Vile wretch, you shall die as traitors die!”exclaimed Morton, and the clash of steel was incessant. He was muchthe better swordsman, but his impetuosity and anger deprived him of theadvantage of his skill, and stepping backward, Slocum’s long sword,wielded by his long arm, kept him at bay. Morton’s anger increasedwith the difficulty in dealing a deadly thrust, until, in making alunge, he stumbled over a fallen log. Had he been unwounded he wouldhave instantly recovered himself. The wrench to his pierced leg shota thrill of agony to his heart, and the weakened knee refused itsoffice. In a moment Slocum had him on his back and planting his footon the bleeding wound, pressed it with all his might, while he placedthe point of his sword on his throat. A mocking leer lit up his yellowface as he said composedly: “I don’t see how yer mother let you go outalone; you’re green as garden-sass. Thought Major Slocum would be yourobedient servant and lead you and yer infernal Injun past the lines!You poor trash of a Britisher! An you sucked in my talk about honor andlet go yer holt on my throat! You poor innocent, its like stabbing ababy to put my sword through yer gizzard. Say, sonny, wouldn’t you liketo live?”The pain of his wound was excruciating, yet Morton answered composedly,“I’d die a thousand times before I would beg my life of you. I amnot the first of His Majesty’s service to have lost his life throughbelieving there was honor in an American officer.”“I’m a citizen of the great Republic and will be doing a patrioticdooty in killing you, and, like Washington, after hanging Andre, willtake a good square meal with the satisfactory feeling that there is ared-coat less in the world. But there ain’t no comfort in killing achick like you. Say, what will ye give, if I let you go? I will takean order on Montreal. Slocum ain’t the man to refuse to earn an honestdollar and do a charitable action. Yer father maybe is a Lord or aDook, and he can come down handsum. Why don’t yer speak? I ain’t a mindto do all the talking.”“If I was fool enough to believe you and spare your life it is enough.Torture me not with your dishonorable proposals. I can die as becomes aBritish soldier.”“Yer can, eh? Waal, what if I don’t mind to kill you? Perhaps Slocumsees he can make more by toting you into camp. It ain’t every day aBritish officer is caught and I mout get promotion. Kurnel Slocum wouldsound well. Come now, hadn’t yer better sign a little order on yourfather’s agents for a neat little sum, payable to Major Slocum forvally received? Yer wound hurts, don’t it?” enquired Major Slocum witha grin, as he thrust the toe of his boot into it. Involuntarily, Mortongave a stifled shriek of pain and lay gasping, while his tormentorlooked down upon him with a smile, enjoying his sufferings. As Morton’seyes rolled in agony, the sight of Hemlock met their gaze. He wasstealing stealthily up behind Slocum, who stood all unconscious of hisdanger, torturing his victim in the hope he would purchase his release.Nearer the Indian came; his arms now opened out,--he stood behindSlocum,--they closed,--he was in their grasp, and was thrown with aheavy thud on the ground, when, Hemlock bound his arms and legs withhis sash. Then, with dreadful calmness, he drew his scalping-knife andknelt, one knee on the breast of the prostrate man. “Many times youhave escaped me, Slocum, but you die now. The oki granted what I asked;the spell is gone. I tracked you long, but now you are mine. I will notkill you at once. You shall die by inches, and have a taste, before thedark cloud swallows you, of the bitterness I have drank at your handsfor years.”So saying, with infernal ingenuity, the heritage of his tribe in theart of torture, he stripped Slocum of his clothing and proceeded todraw cuts with his knife on different parts of the body, nowhere makingan incision any deeper than requisite to cause the quivering flesh tofeel the full pain. The wretched man plied the Indian with all mannerof promises to induce him to desist, and on seeing he was relentlessin his purpose, was about to shriek in the hope of attracting aid,when Hemlock caught him by the throat, and snatching up handfuls offorest-litter forced them into his mouth. Then he resumed his dreadfultask. Morton, who had alternated from a state of semi-stupor to thatof insensibility, looked on in his lucid intervals with sickenedhorror, and begged Hemlock to desist. He paid not the slightest heedbut went on for hours, gloating over the agonies of his victim, andadding a fresh wound as the others dulled. Alert even in his dreadfulemployment, a rustle in the bush caught his ear, and he listened. “Itis the Yankee picket going to the blockhouse. If Hemlock could take youwith him he would, but you cannot travel. They will make you prisonerand care for your wound. And now Hemlock must finish his revenge.” Withone swift sweep of the knife, he cut the throat of his now faintingvictim, with another he severed his scalp, and flourishing it abovehis head, vanished in the woods. Immediately afterwards a body of blueuniformed soldiers appeared, who shouted with surprise at seeing themajor, naked, stiff and scalped, and a wounded British officer lyingnear him. Part hurried to each. As those who went to the side of Mortonstooped over him and moved him, he fainted.CHAPTER IV.When Morton recovered consciousness he found he was in a largeapartment, the sides formed of heavy logs, and surrounded by Americansoldiers, who were talking excitedly of the discovery of the dead bodyof Major Slocum. On seeing their prisoner was restored to his senses,they plied him with questions, in the hope of clearing up the mystery,but he felt so languid that he made no reply, and simply begged forwater. On the arrival of two ox-carts, the corpse was lifted into oneand the wounded man into the other. On being carried into the air,Morton saw that the building he had been in was a small blockhouse, soplaced as to command the road which led to Canada. The jolting of thecart during the short drive was agony to him, and he was thankful whenthe log shanties of the village of Four Corners came in sight and therows of tents of the camp. The cart halted at the door of a tavern,where he assumed the general must be, and soon an orderly came out anddirected the driver to an outhouse, into which two soldiers carriedhim. It was a small, low-roofed stable, and in one of the stalls theylaid Morton. Closing the door, he was left in darkness, and so remaineduntil it reopened to admit what proved to be a surgeon. He examinedthe wound, picked it clean, put in a few stitches, bound a wet-bandageround it, and had a pail of water placed near. “You keep that clothwet,” he said to Morton, “and drink all you please, it will keep downthe fever, and you will be well in a week. You have only a flesh-cut;had it been on the inside of the leg instead of the front you wouldhave been a dead man in five minutes.”“I am very weak.”“Yes; from loss of blood; I will send you some whisky and milk.”When the attendant appeared with the stimulant, Morton sickened atthe smell of the whisky, but drank the milk. The man approved of thearrangement and disposed of the whisky. Having placed clean strawbelow Morton, he left him, barring the door. The soothing sensation ofthe wet bandage lulled him to sleep, and he slumbered soundly untilawakened by the sound of voices at the door.“Now, mem, you’d better go home and leave Jim alone.”“You tell me he’s wounded, and who can nurse him better than his oldmother?”“Be reasonable; the doctor said he was not to be disturbed.”“Oh, I will see him; look what I have brought him--a napkin full of thecakes he liked and this bottle of syrup.”“Leave them, my good woman, with me and he will get them.”“No, no, I must see my handsome boy in his uniform; my own Jimmy thatnever left my side until he listed the day before yesterday. The sightof me will be better than salve to his hurt.”“I can’t let you in; you must go to the colonel for an order.”“An order to see my own son! Jimmy, don’t you hear me; tell the man tolet me in to you. (A pause.) Are you sleeping, Jimmy? It’s your motherhas come to see you. (Here she knocked). Are you much hurt? Just ascratch, they tell me; perhaps they will let you go home with me tillit heals. O, Jimmy, I miss you sorely at home.”Again the woman knocked and placing her ear to a crack in the doorlistened.“He ain’t moving! Soger man, tell me true, is my Jimmy here?”“He is, mem; you must go to the colonel. I cannot let you in; I mustobey orders.”“If Jimmy is here, then he must be worse than they told me.”“Very likely, mem; it is always best to be prepared for the worst.”“He may be dyin’ for all you know. Do let me in.”“There is the captain passing; ask him.”“What’s wanted, Bill?”“This is Jimmy’s mother and she wants to see him. Come and tell her.”“That I won’t,” answered the captain, with an oath, “I want to have ahand in no scene; do as you like to break it to the old woman,” and onthe captain passed.“What does he mean? Jimmy ain’t to be punished, is he? He would not dowrong. It was just Tuesday week he went to the pasture for the cows andas he came back, there marched a lot of sogers, with flags aflying anddrums and fifes playin’ beautiful. ‘O, mother,’ says he, ‘I would liketo join em,’ an he kept acoaxin an aworryin me until I let him come upto the Corners an take the bounty, which he brings back to me, dressedin his fine clothes, the lovely boy.”“Now, good woman, you go home an’ I will send you word of him.”“That I won’t; if Jimmy is here I see him. Word came this morning thatthe Injuns had sprang on to the camp an’ there was a soger killed,stone dead, an’ two taken prisoners. An’, says I, lucky Jimmy ain’t oneof them, for so they told me, an’ I will hurry up my chores an’ go andsee him this evenin’, an’ here I am. An’ at the camp they tells me heis over here, and won’t you let me see him?”“Your Jimmy, mem, yes, your Jimmy is----By God, I can’t speak the word.Here, take the key and go in; you’ll find him right in front o’ thedoor.”The door opened and Morton saw a tidy little woman, poorly dressed,step in. She looked wonderingly around, glancing at him in her searchfor her son. Not seeing him, she stepped lightly towards a heapcovered with an army blanket, of which she lifted a corner, gave apitiful cry, and fell sobbing on what lay beneath. To his horror andpity, Morton perceived it was the corpse of a youth, the head with abloody patch on the crown, from having been scalped. “This is whatPerrigo’s men did,” he thought, “and this is war.” Here two women,warned by the sentry of what was passing, entered and did what theycould to soothe the inconsolable mother. The succeeding half hour,during which preparations were made for burial, was accounted byMorton the saddest in his life, and when the detachment arrived witha coffin to take the body away, and he saw it leave, followed by theheart-broken mother, he breathed a sigh of relief and took a mentaloath that it would go ill with him if he did not help the poor woman tothe day of her death.Some biscuit were brought to him, the bucket refilled withspring-water, the door closed, and barred, and he was left for thenight. Weakness from loss of blood made him drowsy, and forgettinghis miserable situation, he slept soundly until next morning, when hewoke feeling more like himself than he could have believed possible.His wound felt easy and he was glad to find he could move without muchpain. The doctor looked in, nodded approval of his condition, andsaid he would send him breakfast, after partaking of which Mortonturned his attention to his personal appearance, and with the aidof water, which the sentry got him as wanted, improved it somewhat.The day passed without incident, no one interrupting the monotony ofhis imprisonment. From the sound of wagon-wheels and the hurrying ofmessengers to and from the tavern, he surmised the army was preparingto move, and that in the bustle he was forgotten. The following morninghis vigor had returned to such a degree that he fell to examining hisprison-house and so far as he could, by peeping through crevices in itswalls of logs, his surroundings, with a view to endeavoring to escape.He had finished breakfast, when an officer appeared, who introducedhimself as Captain Thomas of the staff and announced that the Generalwished to see him. By leaning rather heavily on the American, whoproved to be a gentlemanly fellow, Morton managed to hobble the shortdistance to Smith’s tavern, and was led directly to the General’s room.On entering, Morton saw a fine-looking old gentleman of dignifiedbearing, whom he recognized as the one he saw inspecting the troops onthe evening of the surprise. He sat in a rocking-chair and before himstood a rough-looking farmer, with whom he was speaking. Waving Mortonto take a seat, he went on with his conversation.“You tell me your name is Jacob Manning and that you are acquaintedwith every inch of the country between here and Montreal. I willgive you a horse from my own stud, which no Canadian can come withinwind of, and you will go to the British camp and bring me word of itsstrength?”“No, sir,” replied the backwoodsman.“You will be richly rewarded.”“That’s no inducement.”“Fellow, you forget you are my prisoner, and that I can order you to beshot.”“No, I don’t, but I’d rather be shot than betray my country.”“Your country! You are American born. What’s Canada to you?”“True enough, General, I was brought up on the banks of the Hudson andwould have been there yet but for the infernal Whigs, who robbed usfirst of our horses, then of our kewows, and last of all of our farms,and called their thievery patriotism. If we Tories hadn’t had so muchproperty, there wouldn’t a ben so many George Washington-Tom Jeffersonpatriots. When we were hunted from our birthplace for the crime ofbeing loyal to the good King we were born under, we found shelterand freedom in Canada, and, by God, sir, there ain’t a United Empireloyalist among us that wouldn’t fight and die for Canada.”“You rude boor,” retorted Gen. Hampton hotly, “we have come to giveliberty to Canada, and our armies will be welcomed by its down-troddenpeople as their deliverers. I have reports and letters to that effectfrom Montreal and, best of all, the personal report of one of mystaff, now dead, sent on a special mission.”“Don’t trust ’em, General. We who came from the States know what youmean by liberty--freedom to swallow Whigery and persecution if yourefuse. The Old Countrymen are stiff as hickory against you, and theFrench--why, at heart, they are against both.”“It is false, sir. I have filled up my regiments since I came to thisfrontier with French.”“It wa’nt for love of you; it was for your $40 bounty.”The General rose and throwing open the shutter, closed to exclude thesunshine, revealed the army in review; masses of infantry moving withpassable precision, a long train of artillery, and a dashing corps ofcavalry. Proudly turning to the farmer he said,“What can stop the sweep of such an army? England may well halt inher guilty career at the sight of these embattled sons of liberty andloosen her bloody clutch upon this continent of the New World.”Neither the sight of the army nor the pompous speech of the Generalappalled the stout farmer, who replied, “The red-coats will make shortwork of ’em, and if you don’t want to go to Halifax you’d better notcross the lines.”General Hampton made no reply, his good-sense apparently checking hispride, by suggesting the folly of arguing with a backwoodsman, whohad chanced to be taken prisoner in a foray. Summoning an orderly, hecommanded that Manning be taken back to prison and not released untilthe army moved.“And now, Lieutenant Morton, for so I understand you are named, you arethe latest arrival from Canada; and what did they say of the Army ofthe North when you left?”“They were wondering when they would have the pleasure of seeing it,”replied Morton.“Ha! it is well to so dissemble the terror our presence on the frontierhas stricken into the mercenaries of a falling monarchy. They will seethe cohorts of the Republic soon enough: ere another sun has risen wemay have crossed the Rubicon.”“The wonder expressed at every mess-table has been the cause of yourtarrying here.”“So I am the topic of the conversation of your military circles,” saidHampton, with a pleased expression. “And what was their surmise as tothe cause of my tarrying here.”“That you were awaiting orders from General Wilkinson.”The General sprung to his feet in anger and excitement. “What! Do theyso insult me? Look you, young man, are you telling the truth or darecome here to beard me?”“On my honor, General Hampton, I only repeat what I have heard ahundred times.”“Then, when you hear it again, that I await the orders of that impudentpill-maker who masquerades at Oswego as a general, say it is a lie!General Hampton takes no orders from him; he despises him as a man andas a soldier--a soldier, quotha! A political mountebank, a tipplerand a poltroon. Here I have been, ready to pluck up the last vestigeof British authority on this continent for two months past, and beenhindered by the government entrusting the Western wing of my army to acraven who refuses to recognize my authority and who lets I would waiton I dare not.”“I meant no offence by my statement,” said Morton, as the Generalpaused in striding the room.“It is well for you that you did not, for I brook no aspersion upon myindependence or my reputation as a veteran who has done somewhat todeserve well of his country, and that is implied in alleging, I take myorders from Wilkinson.”Morton reiterated his regret at having unwittingly given offence andwould assure the General that he had entertained so high an opinionof him that he did not attribute to him the harsh treatment he hadreceived since taken prisoner. Asked of what he complained, he told ofhis having been thrust into a miserable stable and having received nosuch attention as is universally accorded to a wounded officer in camp.The General smiled somewhat grimly as he said: “Lieut. Morton, yourtreatment is no criterion of our hospitality to those whom thefortunes of war throw into our hands. You forget that you were madeprisoner under most suspicious circumstances. You were found lyingwounded beside the mutilated corpse of that influential citizen who,I may so express it, stepped from the political into the militaryarena, the late Major Slocum, and everything points to your having beenassociated with those who slew him and violated his remains. Apartfrom that grave circumstance, the mere fact of your being found on theterritory of the United States government would justify my orderingyour execution as a spy.”“Sir,” indignantly interrupted Morton, “I am no spy. My uniform showsI am an officer of the King’s army and I came upon American soilengaged in lawful warfare, declared not by King George but by your owngovernment. I am a prisoner-of-war but no spy.”“It is undoubted that you consorted with Indians, that you werepresent with them in the childish attempt to surprise my army theother evening, and that you were with one or more redskins when MajorSlocum offered up his life on the altar of his country in a manner thatbefitted so celebrated a patriot, who to his laurels as a statesman hadadded those of a soldier. You must understand, for you appear to be aman of parts and education, that Indians and those who associate withthem are not recognized as entitled to the rights of war. They areshot or hung as barbarous murderers without trial.”“If that is your law, General, how comes it that you have Indians inyour army?”The General looked nonplussed for a moment. “Our Indians,” he answered,“are not in the same category. They have embraced the allegiance of afree government; yours are wild wretches, refugees from our domain andfugitives from our justice, and now the minions of a bloody despotism.”“I do not see that if it is right for your government to availthemselves of the skill of Indians as scouts and guides that it can bewrong for His Majesty’s government to do the same. Between the paintedsavages I perceived in your camp and those in the King’s service, Icould distinguish no difference.”“Keep your argument for the court martial which, tho’ I do not consideryou entitled, I may grant. Leaving that aside, sir, and reminding youof your perilous position, I would demand whether you are disposedto make compensation, so far as in your power, to the government ofthe United States by giving information that would be useful in thepresent crisis? As an officer, you must know much of the strengthand disposition of the British force who stand in my onward path toMontreal.”Morton’s face, pale from his recent wound and confinement, flushed. “Ifyou mean, sir, that you offer me the choice of proving traitor or ofa rope, you know little of the honor of a British soldier or of hissense of duty. It is in your power to hang me, but not to make me falseto my country and my King.”“Come, come young man; do not impute dishonor to a Southerner and agentleman who bore a commission in the Continental army. Leave me,who am so much older and, before you were born, saw service under theimmortal Washington, to judge of what is military ethics. We are alone,and as a gentleman speaking to a gentleman, I demand whether you aregoing to give me information useful in the movement I am about to makeupon Montreal?”“You have had my answer.”The General took up a pen, wrote a few lines, and then rang a bell.Captain Thomas entered. “Take this and conduct the prisoner away,”said the General handing him a folded paper. Morton bowed and left theroom, fully believing that the missive was an order for his execution.Conducted back to the stable, he threw himself on his straw-heap,indignant and yet mortified at being treated as a spy. He thought ofhis relations, of his comrades, of his impending disgraceful death,and then clenched his teeth as he resolved he would not plead with hiscaptors but die without a murmur.The marching of a body of men was heard without. They halted and thedoor was thrown open. The officer in command said he had come toescort him to the court-martial. Morton gave no sign of surprise andlimped as firmly as he could, surrounded by the files of men, to thetent where the court was awaiting him. The clerk read the charges,which were, that he was a spy, that he had associated himself withIndian marauders in an attack on the camp and, that he had been anaccomplice in the murder of Major Slocum. In reply to the usualquestion of guilty or not guilty, Morton answered that he scorned toplead to such charges, that his uniform was the best reply to his beinga spy and if they doubted his right to wear it, he referred them toMajor Stovin at Camp la Fourche; that he had made war in a lawful wayand with men regularly enrolled in the British service, and, beforeGod, he protested he had no hand in the killing of Major Slocum.“That,” said the presiding officer, “is equivalent to your pleading notguilty. The prosecutor will now have to adduce proof of the charges.”The only witnesses were the soldiers who had found him lying in thebush beside the corpse of Major Slocum. Morton peremptorily refusedto answer questions. “You place us in a painful position, LieutenantMorton, by refusing to answer, for we must conclude that you can giveno satisfactory explanation of the circumstances under which youwere captured. A foul, a diabolical murder has been committed, andeverything points to you as being, at least, a party to it. Yourwound in itself is witness against you that you assailed our latecomrade-in-arms.”Morton rose to his feet, and holding up his hand said: “Gentlemen,I stand before you expecting to receive sentence of death and to beshortly in presence of my Maker. At this solemn moment, I repeat mydeclaration, that I had no part in the death of Major Slocum, that Idid not consent to it and that if it had been in my power I would havesaved him.”“I submit, Mr President,” said a member of the court, “that thestatement we have just heard is tantamount to Lieutenant Morton’sdeclaring he knows how and by whom Major Slocum came to his death. Asone who has practised law many years, I assert that the statement justmade is a confession of judgment, unless the defendant informs thecourt who actually committed the murder and declares his willingness togive evidence for the state. If a man admits he was witness to a murderand will not tell who did it, the court may conclude he withholds theinformation for evil purpose, and is justified in sentencing him asan abettor at least. In this case, the wound of the accused points tohis being the principal. Before falling, Major Slocum, in his heroicdefence, deals a disabling wound to this pretended British officer whothereupon leaves it to his associated red-skins to finish him and wreaktheir deviltry on the corpse.”“The opinion you have heard,” said the presiding-officer, “commendsitself to this board. What have you to say in reply?”“Nothing,” answered Morton.“We will give you another chance. We cannot pass over the murder ofa brother officer. Only strict measures have prevented many citizensin our ranks, who esteemed Major Slocum as one of their politicalleaders and of popular qualities, from taking summary vengeance uponyou. We make this offer to you: make a clean breast of it, tell us whocommitted the murder, give us such assistance as may enable us to trackthe perpetrator, and, on his capture, we will set you free.”“And if I refuse,” asked Morton, “what then?”“You will be hanged at evening parade.”“With that alternative, so revolting to a soldier, I refuse your offer.What the circumstances are which bind me to silence, I cannot, as a manof honor, tell, but I again affirm my innocence.”“Lieutenant Morton, what say you: the gallows or your informing us of acruel murderer: which do you choose?”“I choose neither; I alike deny your right to take my life or to extortwhat I choose not to tell.”“Withdraw the prisoner,” ordered the presiding-officer, “while thecourt consults,” and Morton was led a few yards away from the tent.He could hear the voice of eager debate and one speaker in his warmthfairly shouted, “He must be made to tell; we’ll squeeze it out ofhim,” and then followed a long colloquy. An hour had passed when he wasrecalled.“We have deliberated on the evidence in your case, Lieutenant Morton;and the clerk will read the finding of the court.”From a sheet of foolscap the clerk read a long minute, finding theprisoner guilty on each count.Standing up and adjusting his sword, the presiding officer said, “Itonly remains to pronounce sentence: it is, that you be hanged betweenthe hours of five and six o’clock this day.”Morton bowed and asked if the sentence had been confirmed by thecommanding-officer. “It has been submitted and approved,” was the reply.“In the brief space of time that remains to me,” said Morton in a firmvoice, “may I crave the treatment that befits my rank in so far that Imay be furnished with facilities for writing a few letters?”“You may remain here and when done writing, the guard will conduct youback whence you came, there to remain until execution.” With thesewords he rose, and the others followed, leaving Morton alone with theclerk and the captain of his guard. He wrote three letters,--to MajorStovin, to his colonel, and the longest to his relatives across theAtlantic,--being careful in all to say nothing about Hemlock, for hesuspected the Americans would read them before sending. When done, hewas taken back to the stable, and left in darkness. He had abandonedall hope: his voyage across life’s ocean was nearly ended, and alreadyhe thought the mountain-tops of the unknown country he was soon toset foot upon loomed dimly on his inward eye. The hour which comes toall, when the things of this life shrink into nothingness, was uponhim, and the truths of revelation became to him the only actualities.The communings of that time are sacred from record: enough to say,they left a sobering and elevating influence on his character. He wasperfectly composed when he heard the guard return, and quietly tookhis place in the centre of the hollow square. On the field used as aparade ground he saw the troops drawn up in double line. At one endwere the preparations for his execution, a noose dangling from the limbof a tree and a rough box beneath to serve as his coffin. There wasnot a whisper or a movement as he passed slowly up between the linesof troops. It seemed to him there was unnecessary delay in completingthe arrangements; and that the preliminaries were drawn out to a degreethat was agonizing to him. At last, however, his arms were pinionedand the noose adjusted. The officer who had presided at his trialapproached “By authority of the General,” he whispered, “I repeat theoffer made you: assist us to secure the murderer of Major Slocum andyou get your life and liberty.”Morton simply answered, “Good friend, for Jesu’s sake, leave me alone.”The word was not given to haul the tackle and Morton stood facing theassembled ranks for what seemed to him to be an age, though it was onlya few minutes. The bitterness of death was passed and the calmness ofresignation filled his soul. Again the officer spoke, “What say you,Lieutenant Morton?” Morton merely shook his head. Presently a horsemanwas seen to leave the General’s quarters and an orderly rode up. “Bycommand of the General, the execution is postponed.” Morton’s firstfeeling was that of disappointment.As he was hurried back to the stable, the order dismissing the troopswas given. As they broke up, a soldier remarked to his comrade, “They’dsooner have him squeal than stretch his neck.”CHAPTER V.On the afternoon of the second day after the events of last chapter,Allan Forsyth returned from his daily visit to Camp la Fourche excitedand indignant. “What think ye,” he said to his wife and Maggie,“Lieutenant Morton is in the hands o’ the Yankees and they’re gaun tohang him.”Maggie paled and involuntarily stepped nearer her father.“The deils that they be; hoo did they get haud o’ him?” asked MrsForsyth.“The story is sune tell’t,” replied her husband. “He was sent, as yeken, wi’ a despatch to the lines; while there he took part in a bitskirmish, an’ the day after was found by the Yankees lyin’ wounded inthe woods beside the body o’ a Yankee officer.”“Weel, they canna hang him for that. Gin the Yankees will fecht, theymaun expect to be kilt.”“Ah, ye dinna understan. They say their officer wasna kilt in regularcoorse o’ war. The body was scalped and carvt in a gruesome fashion,showing plainly the hand o’ the Indian, an’ they hold Mr Mortonaccountable.”“But he didna scalp the Yankee?”“True, gudewife, but he winna tell them wha did. His sword they foundbeside the corpse, showing they had been in mortal combat.”“Is he sorely wounded?” asked Maggie.“I canna say for that. It’s no likely, for they had him oot ae eveningto hang him, and took a better thocht when he was below the gallows.”“How did you hear all this?”“A messenger came in today with letters from him, sent across the linesunder a flag o’ truce. It was said in camp Major Stovin was stampin’angry and was going to write back that gin a hair o’ the Lieutenant’shead is harmed he will hang every Yankee officer that fa’s into hishans. I gaed ower to see the messenger and he tell’t me the word wentthat Morton defied General Hampton and his officers to do their worst,that, to save his life, he wadna bring disgrace on his commission.”“Who is the messenger: has he gone back?”“He’s a young lad, a son o’ ane o’ the settlers in Hinchinbrook. Hegoes back tomorrow with letters from Major Stovin.”“Will he see Morton?”“No, no: to be sure thae folk on the lines gang back an’ forrit, butthey’re no likely to let him near. His letters will be taken at theoutposts.”“Do you think Major Stovin’s letter will save him?”“That it won’t. The lad said the Yankees were fair wud ower the deatho’ their officer an’ will hang puir Morton to a dead certainty gin hedoesna reveal to them wha did the deed.”“An’ for what will he no tell?” asked Mrs Forsyth.“That he kens best. Maybe gratitude to an Indian ca’d Hemlock seals hislips, for oor men believe he was with him at the time.”“What does Hemlock say?” interjected Maggie.“He’s no in camp. He came back three days ago and left for Oka, wherehe bides.”Until bedtime Morton was the subject of conversation, and the more theytalked of him the keener their interest grew in his serious situation.That one whom they had learned to like and respect so much should diean ignominious death shocked them, and even Mrs Forsyth was constrainedto say, that much as she disliked Yankees, “Gin I were near eneuch towalk to him, I wad gang on my knees to Hampton to beg his life.”Next morning, while engaged in the stable, Mr Forsyth was surprised bythe appearance of his daughter.“Hey, my woman, what’s garrd you to come oot in the grey o’ themornin’? Time eneuch an hour frae this.”“Father, I could not sleep and I wanted to speak to you. If Hemlock wasbrought back, would he not save Morton?”“Ah, he winna come back. Doubtless he kens the Yankees wad rax his neckfor him. His leevin for hame shows he is afeard o’ what he has dune.”“Yet there’s no other hope of saving Morton.”“Too true; gin the actual slayer o’ the officer is not surrenderedwithin a few days poor Morton will suffer.”“Well, then, father, you cannot go to seek for Hemlock, and my brotherswould not be allowed to leave their duty in camp, so I will go. I canbe in Oka before dark and will see Hemlock.”“Dinna think o’ such a thing,” entreated the father, “the road islang an’ the Indian wad just laugh at you gin you found him, which isdootful.”A favorite child has little difficulty in persuading a parent, andbefore many minutes Mr Forsyth was won over, declaring “it wad bea shame gin we did naething to try an’ save the puir lad.” It wasarranged she should go at once, the father undertaking to breakthe news to his wife. All her other preparations having been madebeforehand, the slipping of a plaid over her head and shouldersrendered her fit for the journey, and with a cheery goodbye to herfather she stepped quickly away. She went to the camp at La Fourche,where she surprised her brothers and got them to search out themessenger who had brought the startling tidings. She had a talk withhim, learning all he knew of Morton. Then she went to see the Indiansin camp, who readily enough told what little they knew of Hemlock. Theybelieved he was at Oka and did not expect him back, as he said hewould join the force that was being assembled above Cornwall to meetWilkinson. Thus informed she took the road, a mere bush track, thatled to Annfield Mills, now known as the town of Beauharnois, which shereached in the course of two hours or so and walked straight to thehouse of the only person in it who she thought could help her. It was alog-shanty built on the angle where the St Louis rushes brawling pastand the calm waters of the bay, and was of unusual length, the frontend being devoted to the purposes of an office. The door stood open andMaggie walked into a little den, in one corner of which stood a deskwith pigeon-holes stuffed with papers, and beside it were a few shelvesfilled with bottles and odds-and-ends, the whole dusty, dark, andsmelling of tobacco. At the desk sat a little man, dressed in blue withlarge gilt buttons.“Oh, ho, is this you, Maggie Forsyth? Often have I gone to see you, butthis is the first time you have dropped in to see me.”“See you, you withered auld stick! I just dropped in to speer a fewquestions at you.”“Auld stick, Mag; I’m no sae auld that I canna loe ye.”“Maybe, but I dinna loe you.”“Look here, lassie; see this bit airn kistie; its fu o’ siller dollars;eneuch to varnish an auld stick an keep a silken gown on yer back everyday o’ the year.”“An eneuch in thae dirty bottles to pooshen me when ye wad?”“Ha, ha, my lass; see what it is to hae lear. I didna gang four langsessions to new college, Aberdeen, for naething. I can heal as well aspooshen. It’s no every lassie has a chance to get a man o’ my means andlearnin.”“Aye, an its no every lassie that wad want them alang wi’ an auldwizened body.”“Hech, Mag, ye’re wit is ower sharp. When a man’s going down hill, ilkabody gies him a jundie. If ye winna, anither will, but we’ll let thatflee stick i’ the wa’ for awhile. Where is your faither?”“At hame: I just walked ower.”“Walked ower yer lane, an a’ thae sogers an’ Indians roun!”“If yer ceevil ye’ll meet wi’ ceevilty, Mr Milne; an’ I’m gaun fartherthis day, an’ just looked in for yer advice.”“Oh ye maun hae a drap after your walk,” and here he pulled out a bigwatch from his fob. “Gracious! it is 20 minutes ayont my time for adram.”Stooping beneath the table that answered for a counter, he filled agrimy tin measure, which he tendered to Maggie, who shook her head.“Na, na, I dinna touch it.”Finding persistence useless, he raised the vessel to his mouth and witha “Here’s tae ye,” emptied it. “Hech, that does me guid,--but no forlang. Noo, lass, what can I do to serve you?”Maggie unreservedly told him all. “An’ what’s this young Morton to you?”“Naething mair than ony neebur lad.”“Tell that to my grannie,” said the old buck, “I can see through a whinstane as far as onybody an’ noo unnerstan why ye turn yer back on agraduate o’ new college, Aberdeen, wi’ a kist o’ siller, and a’ for apenniless leftenant.”“Think what thochts ye may, Mr Milne, but they’re far astray. The ladis naething to me nor me to him. I am going to Oka because nae man-bodyis allowed to leave the camp, and I couldna stay at hame gin it was inmy power to save a fellow-creature’s life.”“An what can I do to help you to save him?”“Help me to reach Oka and find Hemlock.”“Were it no for thae stoury war-times I wad get out my boat and gangmysel’, and there’s naebody to send wi’ you. My lass, gif ye’ll no turnhame again, ye’ll have to walk the road your lane.”“I hae set my face to the task an’ I’ll no gang hame.”“Weel, then, ye’ll hae a snack wi’ me an’ I’ll direct ye as well as maybe.”A few rods up the St Louis, in the centre of the stream, where ittrickled over a series of rocky shelves, stood a small mill, and on theadjoining bank the house of the miller, and thither they went and hadsomething to eat. The miller’s wife, a good-looking woman, could notspeak English, but made up her lack in lively gesticulations, whileMaggie helped the common understanding with odd words and phrases inFrench. Justice done to the food hurriedly spread before them, Maggiewalked back with Milne until they stood in front of the house.“There,” he said, pointing to planks resting on big stones, “you crossthe St Louis and keep the track until you come to the first house afteryou pass the rapids. It is not far, but the road is shockingly bad.There you will ask them to ferry you to the other side, when you’ve along walk to the Ottawa before you. I’d advise you to turn yet.” Maggieshook her head decisively. “Weel, weel, so be it; he that will toCupar maun to Cupar. Here tak this,” and he put in her hand two silverdollars.Maggie winced. “I’ll hae nae need o’ siller.”“Ye dinna ken; ye may get into trouble that money will help you out o’.Dinna fear to take it; I’ve made (and here his voice sank to a whisper)I’ve made a hunner o’ thae bricht lads by ae guid run o’ brandy kegsacross the Hinchinbrook line. It’s Yankee siller.”Maggie smiled and, as if the questionable mode of their acquisitionjustified their acceptance, clasped them, and nodding to the littleman, tripped her way to the other side of the river. The road, aspredicted, proved execrable. Walled in and shadowed by trees, neitherbreeze nor sunlight penetrated to dry it, and it was a successionof holes filled with liquid mud. So bad was it, that an attempt tohaul a small cannon along it had to be abandoned despite the effortsof horses, oxen, and a party of blue jackets. Tripping from side toside, and occasionally passing an unusually deep hole by turning intothe bush, Maggie made all haste. Once only she halted. A party ofartillerymen and sailors were raising a breastwork at the head of theCascade rapids, whereon to mount a gun that would sweep the river, andshe watched them for a while. That was the only sign of life alongthe road until the white-washed shanty of the ferryman came in sight,in front of which a troop of half-naked children were tumbling inboisterous play, and who set up a shrill cry of wonder when they sawher. Their mother, so short and stout as to be shapeless, came to thedoor in response to their cries and gazed wonderingly at the stranger.She volubly returned Maggie’s salutation and led her into the house,the interior of which was as bare as French Canadian houses usuallyare, but clean and tidy. Her husband was away, helping to convey storesto the fort at the Coteau, and there was not, to her knowledge, a manwithin three miles capable of ferrying her across. Could not madampaddle her over? The woman’s hands went up in pantomimic amazement.Would she tempt the good God by venturing in a canoe alone with awoman? Did she not know the current was swift, and led to the rapidswhose roaring she heard! No, she must stay overnight, and her good manwould take her over in the morning. Maggie could only submit and seatedherself behind the house, to gaze towards the other bank which she wasso anxious to set foot upon. From where she sat, the bank abruptly sankto a depth of perhaps thirty feet, where a little bay gave shelter toa canoe and a large boat fitted to convey a heavy load. Beyond therocks that headed the tiny inlet, which thus served as a cove forthe ferryman’s boats, the river swept irresistibly, and where in itschannel between the shore and the islands that shut out the view ofthe north bank, any obstacle was met, the water rose in billows withfoaming heads. Maggie knew that she was looking upon the south channelof the great river, and that the main stream lay on the other side ofthe tree-covered islands, which varied in size from half a mile long torocks barely large enough to afford foothold to the tree or two whosebranches overhung the foaming current. The motion of the rushing watercontrasted so finely with the still-life and silence of the forestthat framed it, and the many shaped and many colored islands thatdiversified its surface, that the scene at once soothed the anxiousmind of the peasant maid and inspired her with fresh energy.“Time is passing like that mighty stream,” she thought, “and beforeanother sunset help for Morton may be too late,” and then she askedherself why she, so used to the management of a canoe, should notpaddle herself across? She sought out madam and told her what sheproposed, was met with energetic protestation, and then was allowed tohave her own way. Fortified with directions which she only partiallyunderstood, Maggie took her place in the canoe, and waving good-bye tomadam and her troop of children, who stood on the landing, pushed out.Unmindful of how the light skiff drifted downwards, she kept its headpointed to the island that lay opposite to her and paddled for dearlife. Once she received a shower of spray in passing too near to wherethe current chafed and fumed over a sunken rock, but she retained herpresence of mind, and was glad to see the island draw nearer with eachstroke. Just as the gravelly strand seemed within reach, the driftbrought her nigh to the end of the island, and she paddled into thechannel that lay between it and the islets adjoining, which nestled soclosely that the tops of the trees upon them interlaced, furnishing aleafy arcade to the narrow channels that divided them. As Maggie pausedfor breath after her severe exertion, a sense of the quiet beauty andsecurity of the retreat came over her, and drawing the canoe on to thepebbly beach, she laved her feet while, idly picking from the bushesand vines within reach, she formed a bouquet of colored leaves. Sheheard the roar of the rapids beneath and she knew that a few yardsfarther on lay the deep-flowing north channel, but her nature wasnot one to borrow trouble and she enjoyed the present to the full inher cool retreat. When she again took her place in the canoe, a fewdips of the paddle took it outside the islands, and she saw the mainchannel of the river--smooth except for great greasy circles of slowlywhirling water, as if the mighty river, after its late experience ofbeing shredded in the rapids above, had a nightmare of foreboding of arepetition of the same agony in the rapids to which it was hastening.With steady stroke Maggie urged the canoe forward and did not allow theconsciousness that she was drifting toward the rapids discompose her.As the canoe neared the bank, the sweep of the current increased, andher arms began to ache with the violent and long-continued exertion.To her joy, she saw a man standing at the landing and the strokes ofher paddle quickened. The canoe was swept past the landing, when theman, picking up a coil of rope, ran downwards to a point, and watchinghis chance, threw it across the canoe. Maggie caught an end of therope, and in a minute was hauled ashore. The man, a French Canadianemployed to assist the bateaux in passing between lakes St Francis andSt Louis, expressed his astonishment at a woman daring so perilous afeat, and his wonder increased when she told him of her intention ofgoing to Oka. “Alone! mademoiselle,” he exclaimed, “why you will loseyour way in the forest which is full of bears and Indians.” She smiledin answer, and receiving his directions, sought the blazed track whichled to the Ottawa. Familiar with the bush, she had no difficulty infollowing the marks, for the litter of falling leaves had begun toshroud the path. The tapping of the woodpecker and the chirrup of thesquirrel cheered her, and she pressed on with a light and quick step.Hours passed until the gloom that pervaded the forest told her the sunhad ceased to touch the tree-tops and she wished the Ottawa would comein sight. While giving way to a feeling of dread that she might haveto halt and, passing the night in the woods, await daylight to showher the way, the faint tinkle of a bell reached her. With expectantsmile she paused, and poising herself drank in the grateful sound.“It is the bell of the mission,” she said, and cheerfully resumed herjourney. All at once, the lake burst upon her view--a great sweep ofglassy water, reflecting the hues of the evening sky, and sleeping atthe foot of a long, low hill, covered to its double-topped summit withsombre-foliaged trees. At the foot of the slope of the western end ofthe hill, she distinguished the mission-buildings and, running aboveand below them, an irregular string of huts, where she knew the Indiansmust live, and behind those on the river’s edge rose a singular cliffof yellow sand. The path led her to where the lake narrowed into ariver and she perceived a landing-place. Standing at the farthestpoint, she raised her hand to her mouth and sent a shout across thewaters, long, clear, and strong, as she had often done to her fatherand brothers, while working in the bush, to tell of waiting-meals. Inthe dusk, she perceived a movement on the opposite bank and the launchof a canoe, which paddled rapidly across. It contained two Indians,whose small eyes and heavy features gave no indication of surprise onseeing who wanted to be ferried. Stepping lightly in, the canoe swiftlyskimmed the dark waters, which now failed to catch a gleam from thefading glories of the evening sky. The silence was overwhelming, andas she viewed the wide lake, overshadowed by the melancholy mountain,Maggie experienced a feeling of awe. At that very hour she knew herfather would be conducting worship, and as the scene of her lovedhome passed before her, she felt a fresh impulse of security, and shemurmured to herself, “My father is praying for me and I shall trust inthe Lord.”On getting out of the canoe she was perplexed what step to take next.To her enquiries, made in English and imperfect French, the Indiansshook their heads, and merely pointed her to the mission-buildings.Approaching the nearest of these, from whose open door streamed theglowing light of a log-fire, she paused at the threshold on seeing awoman kneeling, and who, on hearing her, coolly turned, surveyed herwith an inquisitive and deliberate stare, and then calmly resumed herdevotions. When the last bead was told, the woman rose and bade herwelcome. Maggie told her of her errand. The woman grew curious as towhat she could want with an Indian. Yes, she knew Hemlock, but had notseen him; he is a pagan and never comes near the presbytery. The fatherhad gone into the garden to repeat his office and had not returned;she would ask him when he came in. Mademoiselle could have had nosupper; mon Dieu, people did not pick up ready-cooked suppers in thewoods, but she would hasten and give her of her best. It was a treatto see a white woman, even if she was an Anglais and, she feared, aheretic. The embers on the hearth were urged into a blaze, and beforelong a platter of pottage, made from Indian corn beaten into a paste,was heated, sprinkled over with maple-sugar and set down with a bowlof curdled-cream on the table. Maggie had finished her repast when thepriest entered. He was a lumpish man with protruding underlip, whichhung downwards, small eyes, and a half-awakened look. “Ah, good-day,”he said with a vacant stare. Maggie rose and curtsied, while thehousekeeper volubly repeated all she had learned of her and her errand.“Hemlock!” he exclaimed, “we must take care. He is a bad Indian andthis young woman cannot want him for any good.”“True; I never thought of that.”“Ah, we must keep our eyes always open. What can a girl like this wantwith that bold man?”“And to run after him through the woods, the infatuate! We must saveher.”“I will have her sent to the sisters, who will save her body and soulfrom destruction. She would make a beautiful nun.” And the priestrubbed his chubby hands together.“May it please your reverence,” interposed Maggie, who had caught thedrift of their talk, “I seek your aid to find Hemlock. If you will nothelp me, I shall leave your house.”The priest gasped for a minute with astonishment. “I thought you wereEnglish; you understand French?”“Enough to take care of myself, and I wish ministers of your robe weretaught in college to have better thoughts of us poor women.”“It is for your good we are instructed; so that we can guard you by ouradvice.”“For our good you are taught to think the worst of us! I look forHemlock that he may go and give evidence that will save a man condemnedto die. For the sake of innocency I ask your help.”The priest shrugged his shoulders, stared at her, gathered up his robe,grasped his missal with one hand and a candle with the other, andsaying, “I leave you with Martine,” passed up the open stairway to hisbedroom.“Ah, the holy father!” ejaculated the housekeeper, “when we are sunkin stupid sleep, he is on his knees praying for us all, and the demonsdare not come near. Will you not come into the true church? SisterAgatha would teach you. She has had visions in her raptures. Mon Dieu,her knees have corns from kneeling on the stone steps of the altar. Youwill not. Ah, well, I will ask their prayers for you and the scales maydrop from your eyes.”“Do tell me, how I can find Hemlock?” pleaded Maggie, and the currentof her thoughts thus changed, Martine insisted on learning why and howhis evidence was needed, and Maggie repeated as much of the story aswas necessary. The housekeeper grew interested and said decisively,“the young brave must not die.” Covering her head with a blanket-likeshawl, she told Maggie to follow, and stepped out. It was a calm, clearnight, the glassy expanse of the lake reflecting the stars. Hurryingonwards, they passed a number of huts, until reaching one, they enteredits open door. The interior was dark save for the faint glow thatproceeded from the dying embers on the hearth. Maggie saw the forms ofseveral asleep on the floor and seated in silence were three men. “Thiswoman has come to find Hemlock; can you guide her to him?”“What seeks she with him?”“She has come from the Chateaugay to tell him his word is wanted tosave his best friend from death.”The conversation went on in the gutturals of the Iroquois for sometime, when the housekeeper said to Maggie, “It is all right; they knowwhere Hemlock is, but it would not be safe to go to him now. They willlead you to him at daybreak. Come, we will go back and you will staywith me until morning.”CHAPTER VI.The rising of the housekeeper, whose bed she shared, woke Maggie, anda glance through the small window showed a faint whitening in the skythat betokened the coming of day. Knowing there was no time to spare,she dressed herself quickly, and, joining the housekeeper in thekitchen, asked if the messenger had come. She answered by pointing tothe open door, and Maggie saw, seated on the lowest step, in silentwaiting, the figure of an Indian. She was for going with him at once,when the housekeeper held her and, fearful of disturbing her master,whispered to eat of the food she had placed on the table. Having madea hurried repast, Maggie drew her shawl over her head and turned tobid her hostess good-bye. The good soul forced into her pocket thebread that remained on the table, and kissed her on both cheeks. WhenMaggie came to the door, the Indian rose and, without looking at her,proceeded to lead the way through the village and then past it, by apath that wound to the top of the sand-hill that hems it in on thenorth. Motioning her to stand still, the Indian crept forward as if tospy out the object of their search. Glancing around her, Maggie sawthrough the spruces the Ottawa outstretched at her feet, reflecting thefirst rosy gleam of the approaching sun. A twitch at her shawl startledher. It was her guide who had returned. Following him, as he slowlythreaded his way through the grove of balsams and spruces, they sooncame to a halt, and the Indian pointed to a black object outstretchedupon the ground a few yards from them. Fear overcame Maggie, and sheturned to grasp the arm of her guide--he was gone. Her commonsense cameto her aid. If this was Hemlock, she had nothing to fear, and masteringher agitation she strove to discover whether the figure, which thedawn only rendered perceptible amid the gloom of the evergreens, wasreally the object of her quest. Silently she peered, afraid to move ahairsbreadth, for what seemed to her to be an age, and she came to seeclearly the outline of a man, naked save for a girdle, fantasticallyfashioned out of furs of varied colors, stretched immoveable on thesod, face downward. Suddenly a groan of anguish escaped from the lipsof the prostrate man and the body swayed as if in convulsions. Hersympathies overcame her fears, and advancing Maggie cried, “Hemlock,are you ill? Can I help you?”With a terrific bound the figure leapt to its feet, the right armswinging a tomahawk, and, despite an effort at control, Maggieshrieked. The light was now strong enough to show the lineaments ofthe Indian, whose face and body were smeared with grease and soot andwhose countenance wore the expression of one roused from deep emotionin sudden rage.“Hemlock, do not look at me so; I am Maggie Forsyth, come from theChateaugay to seek you.”Instantly the face of the Indian softened. “Why should the fawn leavethe groves of the Chateaugay to seek so far the lair of the lynx?”“Your friend Morton is doomed to die by the American soldiers and youalone can save him.”“What! Did he not escape? Tell me all.”Maggie told him what she knew, he listening with impassive countenance.When she had done, he paused, as if reflecting, and then said curtly,“I will go with you.” It was now fair daylight, and Maggie saw, to herdismay, that the mound upon which she had found Hemlock outstretchedwas a grave, and that, at the head of it was a stake upon which hungseveral scalps, the topmost evidently cut from a recent victim.Glancing at the radiant eastward sky, the Indian started, and ignoringthe presence of his visitor, fell on his knees on the grave, andturning his face so as to see the sun when it should shoot its firstbeam over the broad lake, which was reflecting the glow of the rosyclouds that overhung its further point, he communed with the dead.“I leave thee, Spotted Fawn, for a while, that I may meet those whodid thee hurt and bring back another scalp to satisfy thy spirit. Thyfather’s arm is strong, but it is stronger when he thinks of thee.Tarry a while before you cross the river and I will finish my task andjoin thee in the journey to the hunting-ground; the arm that oft boreyou when a child, will carry you over the waters and rocks. Farewell!Oh, my child, my daughter, how could you leave me? Tread softly andslowly, for I will soon leave my lodge of sorrow and see you and claspyou to my heart.” There was a pause, a groan of unutterable sorrowescaped his lips, and he sank lifeless upon the grave. Agitated withdeep sympathy, Maggie stepped forward and kneeling beside the Indianstroked his head and shoulders as if she had been soothing a child.“Dinna tak on sae, Hemlock. Sair it is to mourn the loved and lost, butwe maun dae our duty in this warl and try to live sae as to meet themin the warl ayont. He that let the stroke fa’, alane can heal the hurt.Gin yer daughter is deed, it is only for this life. Her voice will bethe first to welcome you when you cross death’s threshold.”“I saw her an hour ago. It is your creed that says the dead are notseen again in this life. I got the medicine from my father that meltsthe scales from our earthly eyes for a while. Last night I saw mychild--last night she was in these arms--last night my cheek felt thewarmth of her breath--last night my ears joyed in the ripple of herlaughter. Oh, my Spotted Fawn, the joy, the life of my heart, why didyou stray from me?” Then, his mood changing, he sprang up with thewords, “Cursed be the wolves that hunted you, cursed be the catamountthat crept near that he might rend you! I will seek them out, I willtrack them day by day, until I slay the last of them.” Here he groundhis teeth and remained absorbed for a minute, then turning sharply,with a wave of the hand, he beckoned Maggie to follow, and led to theverge of the cliff overhanging the Ottawa. “Stay here until I comeback,” he whispered and, disappeared over the declivity.The glorious landscape outstretched at her feet soothed, as naughtelse could, the agitation of Maggie’s mind, for Nature’s touch is evergentle and healing. The great expanse of water, here narrowed into abroad river, there swelling into a noble lake, was smooth as a mirror,reflecting hill and tree and rock. Beyond it, was unrolled the forestas a brightly colored carpet, for the glory of Autumn was upon it, anda trail of smoky mist hung on the horizon. An hour might have sped,when Hemlock reappeared, with paint washed off and dressed in hisusual attire. Across his back was slung his rifle; at his heel was agaunt, ill-shaped dog. “Follow,” he said, and turning backward a fewpaces, led to where the bank could be descended without difficulty. Atthe foot of it, lay waiting a canoe, with a boy in the bow. Maggiestepped lightly into the centre, and Hemlock grasping the paddle, shotthe light skiff swiftly across the stream. When the opposite bank wasgained, he sprang ashore and was followed by Maggie. The boy, without aword, paddled back to the village.Hemlock was in no mood for conversation. The exhaustion following uponhis night-vigil was upon him, and he strode forward through the forestwithout speaking, Maggie following his guidance. Once he halted, onseeing his dog creeping forward on scenting game. Picking up a stick,he stepped lightly after it, and when a covey of partridges rose, threwhis missile so successfully that two of the birds dropped. Tying themto his belt, he resumed his monotonous trot, and several miles werepassed when the sharp yelps of the dog suddenly arrested their steps.The alarm came from a point to their left. Hemlock, unslinging hisrifle, ran in the direction of the dog, whose baying was now intenseand continuous, and Maggie, afraid of losing sight of him, hastenedafter. A short run brought the Indian to the edge of a slough, in athicket in the centre of which his dog was evidently engaged in mortalcombat with some wild animal. Without a moment’s hesitation, the Indianstarted to pick his way across the morass; partially dried by theprolonged drought, and had passed the centre, when there was a crashingof branches and a huge bear burst out, followed by the dog, which waslimping, from a fractured paw. Before he could turn aside, Hemlock wasknocked down by the lumbering brute, which gained the solid ground andwas hurrying forward, when, seeing Maggie coming, it sprang for a hugebeech tree, with the intent of climbing it. Before it was a yard up,the dog overtook it, had fastened its teeth in its hide and pulled itdown. The bear, roused to utmost ferocity by being thwarted, easilycaught hold of the disabled dog, held it in its forepaws, and standingon its hind feet, with back resting against the tree, was proceeding tohug its victim to death, when Hemlock came up. He had dropped his riflein the slough, and instead of waiting to pick it up, had rushed forwardto rescue his dog. With upraised hatchet he approached the bear, anddealt it so terrific a stroke, that the light weapon stuck in theskull. With a growl of rage and pain, the bear flung the dog down andbefore Hemlock could recover himself after dealing the blow, fell uponhim, too stunned and weak, however, to do more than keep him under. Oncatching her first glimpse of the bear, Maggie’s inclination was toflee, but, the next moment, the instinct of self-preservation gave wayto a feeling of sympathy for the disabled dog, followed by absorbingexcitement as the contest went on. When Hemlock fell underneath thebrute, she gave a shriek, and rushed to where the rifle lay. Snatchingit, she ran to the bear, which lay panting with outstretched tongueand half-closed eyes, and dealt him a blow with the butt. With a groanthe unwieldy animal rolled over motionless, and Hemlock sprang to hisfeet, and drew his knife. It was unnecessary; the bear was dead. Maggielooked wildly at the Indian, strove to speak, tottered, and fell: thereaction from the delirium of excited feeling that had sustained herhaving set in. Tenderly Hemlock raised her in his arms, and carryingher to the edge of the swamp, scooped up sufficient water to bathe herforehead. A few anxious minutes passed, when the pallor began to passaway, and suddenly opening her eyes, Maggie asked, “What of the dog?”“Never mind Toga; are you hurt?”“No; are you?”“I am as well as ever, and had not my foot slipped after striking thebear, would have spared you what you did.”“That does not matter,” said Maggie, simply, “it was God that put itinto my silly head to get the gun and it was His strength that gave theblow--not mine.”“I care not for your God,” answered Hemlock in a hollow voice, “I haveknown too many who profess to be His followers to believe in Him.”“Dinna speak sae,” pleaded Maggie.“Yesterday,” Hemlock went on, “I met the topped crow that clings to Okawhile taking from a squaw her last beaver-skins to say masses for herdead husband, and I cursed him to his teeth as a deceiver that he mayeat the corn and give back to his dupes the cob.”Unheeding his words, Maggie rose and went towards the dog, which wasstill alive, and began to stroke its head. Its eyes, however, soughtnot her but his master, and when Hemlock put down his hand, the dyinganimal feebly tried to lick it. At this sign of affection, the eyes ofHemlock moistened, and falling on his knees he alternately patted thedog and shook his unhurt paw. “My Toga, my old friend, my help in manya hunt, my comrade when we were alone for weeks in the wilderness, areyou too going to leave me? You are dying, as the Indian’s dog shoulddie, in the fury of the hunt. A claw of the bear I shall wrap in apiece of my wampum belt and put into your mouth, so that Spotted Fawnmay know whose dog you were, and you will serve her and follow heruntil I join you in the happy hunting-ground--and that will not belong.”As if sensible of what he said the dog whimpered, and with a lasteffort placed its head in his outstretched hands. Then it gave a kickor two, and died.The Indian rose, and selecting a knoll where spruces grew thickly,kindled a fire. Wrapping the two partridges tightly in wet grass andseveral folds of green birch bark, he waited until there were embers,on which he placed them, and heaped fresh fuel. Asking Maggie to keepup the fire, he left and was away for some time. When he came back hehad the bear’s pelt and several slices of steak, which he proceededto broil. On lifting the partridges, their bodies came out clean fromtheir covering of feathers, and on tearing them apart the entrails,dried and shrivelled, were easily drawn. Maggie had eaten many apartridge, but a sweeter bite than the breast of one so cooked she hadnever tasted, and with a piece of the bread in her pocket, she made alight but refreshing dinner. The bear-steak she could not look upon,but like qualms did not interfere with Hemlock’s appetite, who ate themwith greater relish because part of his late enemy and the slayer ofhis dog. He had filled his flask with water from a spring near by, andMaggie remarked, if she “only had a pinch o’ saut, she couldna haveasked for a better dinner.” Trimming and scraping the bear’s hide,to make it light as possible, Hemlock wrapped it into a bundle, andstrapped it on his back. Then looking to the priming of his rifle, hetold Maggie he was ready.“But the puir dowg; will ye no bury him?”“I have buried him,” answered Hemlock, “and poisoned the carcase of thebear that it may sicken the wolves that eat of it.”The tongue of Hemlock was now free, and as they trudged on, he keptup a constant conversation, surprising Maggie by the extent of hisinformation and the shrewdness of his judgment. Becoming consciousthat the sun was descending, she expressed a fear that she could notreach home that night. “No, you cannot, and I do not mean you should,but you will rest safe before sunset. I am taking you to the fort atCoteau-du-lac.”“That is oot o’ oor way, Hemlock.”“Not very far; it is necessary I see Colonel Scott as to how to saveMorton.”Maggie said no more, for that was reason enough to go a hundred milesout of the way, though she thought with pain of the anxiety her absencefor another night would give her parents. “Father will think I did notfind Hemlock at Oka and that I am looking for him,” she concluded atlast, “and will not borrow trouble about me.”CHAPTER VII.Colonel Scott was pacing the walk in front of the battery of the littlefort of Coteau-du-lac, viewing alternately lake St Francis, glitteringpeacefully in the rays of the fast westering sun, and the swift-runningriver into which it contracted where he stood, with the surges of therapids farther down. He was tall, and his face was that of a man whohad intellect to conceive and will to put his conceptions into force.To the door of a house larger than any of its neighbors, and beforewhich a sentry paced, the Colonel often glanced and when a lady cameout, he stepped to meet her. It was his wife, who joined him for anairing before dinner. After admiring, as she had done every day sinceher arrival, the contrast between the lake and the river, as it wentsweeping downwards between forest-covered islands, she asked, “And isthere any news? I heard an arrival reported.”“None since the despatch of last night and it said Wilkinson was stillat Sackett’s Harbor.”“So we may not expect his flotilla of boats this week?”“No, and were I in Sir George Prevost’s place, they would never leaveSackett’s Harbor.”“Why, you have told me his Excellency has not sufficient naval force toattack them.”“I would not attack the flotilla; I would render its purpose abortive.What is the American plan of invasion? I can give it to you in anutshell, Helen. Wilkinson is to take possession of the St Lawrencewith his flotilla and is to meet Hampton at the mouth of the Chateaugayriver, when the combined forces will land on the island of Montreal andcapture it and the city. Now, to defeat this plan, it is not necessaryto destroy the flotilla. If the line of communication between Wilkinsonand Hampton is cut, the whole scheme fails.”“And how would you cut the line?”“Why, as I have represented time and again to headquarters, by thecapture of French Mills. Four hundred men could take and hold thatplace, and with it in British hands Wilkinson and Hampton would be ascompletely prevented from acting in concert as if Hampton was back tohis slaves in Carolina and Wilkinson to his gally-pots. It provokesme to see the opportunities our forces miss. The war in the time ofWashington was a series of blunders on our side and it looks as if thesecond was going to be a repetition.”“And you blame his Excellency?”“Yes and his staff. He is brave personally, and he is active tofussiness, but he is unable to plan a campaign or carry it out. Here wehave the flower of the British army arriving by every convoy, yet ourpolicy is a purely defensive one and changed every day. Out upon sucha peddling course of action! I would teach the braggarts who lurk onyonder heights that Canada is not to be invaded with impunity, and thatshe has hearts to dare and die in defence of her independence.”“Well, Norman, it may prove to be all for the best. So far Canada hasrepulsed every attempt at invasion.”“It is not for the best. I have made suggestion after suggestion toimprove the opportunities presented to me, and every one has been setaside, and I am condemned to a course of inaction that galls and fretsme.”Here an orderly approached. “An Indian and a young woman want to speakwith you.”“I will go,” said Mrs Scott.“Do not,” cried the Colonel, “what tete-a-tete may I not have with thelovely squaw.”“Please, sir,” said the orderly, “she is not a squaw. She is white anda Scotchwoman by her speech.”“And young to boot,” exclaimed Mrs Scott archly, “I shall certainlystay and keep you from falling into temptation.”“Bring them this way,” said the Colonel, and the orderly returned withHemlock and Maggie.“In truth an odd-matched pair,” whispered the Colonel as he saw themapproach.“Why, it’s you, Hemlock. I thought you were raising the war-whoop onthe Huntingdon frontier. And who may your companion be? Too young tobe your wife--too fair to be your sweetheart.”The Indian’s features relaxed into the nearest approach they ever cameto a smile, as he answered, “An arrow from another bow than mine hasstruck the doe.”“Well, Hemlock, do you bring me news from Hinchinbrook? When is Hamptongoing to march?”In reply, Hemlock briefly told how he had been at Oka, was soughtout there by Maggie and for what purpose. The Colonel listened withstern expression as he was told of Morton’s peril, and when the Indianhad done, he plied Maggie with questions. When she had told all, theColonel brought his fist down heavily on the cannon beside which hestood as he exclaimed, “I knew these Americans were boasters but I didnot think they were capable of such cruelty. Once they hung a gentlemanwearing His Majesty’s uniform and were allowed to escape under thebelief that, tradesmen and farmers as they were, they knew no better,but if they send a second to the gallows, there is not an officerin Canada who would not consider it his duty to challenge every oneconcerned in the deed.”With a glance of apprehension at her husband, Mrs Scott with admirabletact strove to divert him from his vengeful mood by changing thesubject. Addressing Maggie she asked, “And what is Mr Morton to youthat you should risk the peril of these woods to save him? Is he abrother?”“He is neither kith nor kin to me,” answered Maggie.“The attraction is of another sort, then. Cupid flies his arrows inthese woods as well as the red warrior.”Maggie blushed and the Colonel, forgetting his anger, gallantly came toher rescue. “And if he does, madam, I would say to Master Cupid, giveme the maiden who, like our fair Maggie, would dare the dragons of thefield and flood to save her lover.”“Oh!” retorted Mrs Scott, “that is as much as to say, I would not dothat and more for you. What thankless monsters you men are!”“Nay, spare me, Helen, and as by what she has told us, she has walkedfrom Oka today, perhaps you will take her with you and play thehostess.”“She has done more than walk from Oka today,” said Hemlock, “she killeda bear and saved my life.”“What!” cried Mrs Scott in astonishment, and Hemlock told the storyof the encounter. When he had done the Colonel stepped forward andgrasping Maggie’s hands he said, “I honor you as a brave man honorsa brave woman, and if there is any possibility of saving Mr Morton’slife, it shall be done.”Maggie was too overcome to reply, and Mrs Scott, slipping her arm intohers, led her away to her husband’s quarters, leaving Hemlock and theColonel in eager converse, which lasted until daylight had nearlyfaded and until a servant came with word that dinner was waiting theColonel. Ordering the servant to call one of the sergeants, the Colonelcommitted Hemlock to his hospitable care and then entered his ownquarters. Maggie spent one of the most delightful evenings of her lifein the company of the Colonel and his wife, forgetting her wearinessand the excitement she had passed through in the enjoyment of socialconverse of a brighter and wider scope than she had been accustomed.When bedtime came she was solicitous about being called early sothat Hemlock might not be kept waiting, when the Colonel assured herhe would take her restoration to her home by the Chateaugay intohis own hands. When she made her appearance next day, she found herentertainers seated on the veranda, and was concerned to learn that itwas near noon and that Hemlock had left at sunrise. The anxious lookthat flitted across her face, the Colonel relieved by telling her thatHemlock had chosen a route she could not have followed, across thegreat swamp that lay between the St Lawrence and the Chateaugay, andthat he carried a letter to her father, telling where she was and thatshe would go home by the first safe opportunity.“And now, my dear Maggie,” said Mrs Scott, “You need not be concernedabout those at home but be my companion for a few days. Buried awayhere in these romantic wilds, you cannot conceive what a treat it isto me to have your society.”“You are welcome, Miss Forsyth,” added the Colonel, “and you will geta chance before long of a convoy to Annfield, for I expect one fromKingston by the end of the week.”“But they may be needing me at home, Colonel; my mother is frail and ifthe Yankees have crossed she will be sore in need of my help.”“Make yourself easy as to that,” said the Colonel with a smile.“General Hampton, as I know for an assured fact, has not crossed thefrontier and will not for several days, at least--perhaps never, forhe has no heart in the undertaking. As to Wilkinson coming, I wishhe would. I am just afraid he is going to deprive me of the pleasureof giving him the warm reception I have gone to so much trouble toprepare. After lunch, or rather your breakfast, we will take the boatand see that everything is in order for him.”A couple of hours later they were seated in the Colonel’s long boat,manned by four tars, who, however, were spared the labor of rowingall the way, for the wind was favorable. Heading Grande Isle, theysailed down the south channel of the St Lawrence to a narrow point,where, by means of the trunks of huge trees anchored above where rapidsfoamed, the passage of boats was made impossible and before theseobstructions could be lifted out, the Colonel pointed to his wife andMaggie how a concealed battery aided by sharp-shooters hid among thefoliage that lined the river would decimate the occupants of the boats.He considered the southern channel to be so effectually closed thatWilkinson would not attempt it and would, therefore, have to take thenorthern, where he would have to run the gauntlet of the fire of thefort at Coteau-du-lac. “True it is,” added the Colonel, “that thatchannel is wide and the current swift, yet with a fire from both banksmany boats must needs be crippled or sunk, and those that do escapewould have to face a similar ordeal at Long Point, opposite the Cedarsrapids, where another battery has been placed.”“What if the Americans passed in the dark?” suggested Maggie.“Yes,” added Mrs Scott, “or what if they landed a part of their largeforce before they came within range of the Coteau batteries andassailed them from the land-side?”“All that I have considered. Were they to pass in the dark, they wouldnot see to shoot the rapids properly, and their angry waters would bemore disastrous than our shot. As to a flank movement, I rely on theIndian scouts to bring me word and, fully warned of their coming, thesewoods are so dense and cut up by swamps, that, with a hundred men, Iwould undertake to repulse a thousand.”“So you keep constant watch?” asked Maggie.“Unceasing,” answered the Colonel. “If you take this telescope youwill perceive a sail at the upper end of the lake. It is one of thegunboats on the watch, and which would, on appearance of Wilkinson’sflotilla, either make for Coteau or if the wind were unfavorable send arow-boat. Then, on that farthest island there is a guard of regulars,who are likely to give the island a name, for already it is calledGrenadier island. To the guard on that island, scouts on the southernshore report daily.”“Surely you have contrived well,” exclaimed Maggie, “and I just wishthe Yankees would come and get what you have prepared for them.”“‘Their kail het through the reek, as the Scotch say,’” laughed theColonel, “well I am just afraid I will not see them. Along the river,between Prescott and Cornwall, there is such a succession of points ofattack, that, from all I learn of him, Wilkinson is not soldier enoughto overcome.”In returning, the boat landed the party in a cove on Grande Isle,whence, from under the shade of maples, they scanned the lake,shimmering in the sun, and the islets, heavy with trees richly coloredby Autumn’s fingers, set in it like gems.“This is so pleasant,” remarked Mrs Scott, “that I do not wonder atpeople growing to passionately love Canada. Do you prefer Canada toScotland, Maggie?”“I never saw Scotland,” replied Maggie, “but I dearly love Canada andcan find it in my heart to wish that the Colonel may wring the necksof those who are trying to take it away from us.”“Well said!” shouted the Colonel, “and Canada is so favored by naturein her line of defence and in her climate, that I cannot conceivehow, if her people are true, she can ever come under the heel of aconqueror.”The day passed happily and so did several others. Accompanying MrsScott, Maggie visited the little canals that enabled the boats, thatplied between Montreal and Upper Canada, to overcome the rapids, to seethe lockmen and their families, and watch the peculiar class of men whoassisted the boats in passing upwards, either by poling and towing orby lightening their load with the help of their diminutive carts andponies. With the garrison and its daily life she became familiar, andthe detachment of blue jackets, drafted from the men-of-war at Quebec,partly engaged in manning the gunboats already afloat and in buildingothers, she never wearied in watching. Each day endeared her more toMrs Scott, who, she learned, had sacrificed her comfort and safety,by accompanying her husband on duty. Following the regiment, she hadbeen with him in India, Egypt, and Spain, and, when ordered on specialservice to Canada, had unhesitatingly followed him, leaving their twochildren with friends in England. Maggie saw that her presence was ahelp rather than a drag upon the Colonel, whom she assisted and caredfor as only a true woman can and preserved him from many privationshe must otherwise have undergone. While most anxious to be at homeagain, it was not without a pang of regret that Maggie learned onemorning that a fleet of the King’s bateaux was in sight coming down thelake. An hour afterwards she was on board of one, waving farewell toher friends. Landed at the foot of the Cascade rapids, she walked homebefore sunset.CHAPTER VIII.The army did not begin a forward movement towards Canada on the dayof Morton’s interview with Hampton. It was only the first of severalabortive starts, and the autumn days were drawing towards an end withthe army still encamped at Four Corners. The American public wasindignant at its inaction: much had been expected of the army, yetit had accomplished nothing, and the campaigning season was near anend. The denunciations of the Albany and New York newspapers Hamptoncould not stoop to reply to: those of the Washington authorities heanswered by laying the blame upon Wilkinson. He was to move on Montrealin conjunction with that general, and his failure to leave Sackett’sHarbor he gave as the cause of his own inaction. To the critics whosuggested he had sufficient strength to capture Montreal unaided, herepresented that his orders from Washington expressly required him toco-operate with the flotilla that was hugging the shelter of Sackett’sHarbor. If he was left free to act by the secretary-of-war, he wouldshow the country what he could do, but he was not free. There werethose who thought his excuses were the offspring of his secret wish,to get out of the campaign without risking any great movement. In allthose days of dallying, Morton lay forlorn in the stable, sick of hisconfinement and of prolonged suspense, until the doctor, taking pityupon him, asked, if the General could be induced to grant him thefreedom of the camp on parole, would he accept it? Eager to get out ofhis dismal prison and hopeless of escape, Morton eagerly embraced theoffer, and next day he was told he was at liberty to leave his wretchedabode during daylight. The boon proved to be of less advantage than hehad anticipated. The officers would not consort with him, professing tobelieve he had been a party to the disfigurement and murder of theirlate comrade, and the rank-and-file swore at him as an abettor of theIndians and as a Britisher. The miscarriage of the campaign had souredthe tempers of the troops, and they were ready to vent it upon Mortonor any other of the enemy who came within reach of their tongues. Aftera few hours’ unpleasant experience, Morton returned to his stableindignant and humiliated. Altho’ thus cut off from intercourse with themilitary, he enjoyed the freedom of moving about. Even lying on thegrass and watching the face of nature, was inexpressibly sweet to him.In course of time he scraped acquaintance with a few civilians, andespecially with a storekeeper, Douglass, a Scotchman, who showed himsuch kindness as he dared without bringing upon himself the suspicionof disloyalty. The weather, which had been uninterruptedly dry andhot, underwent a sudden change, to wet and cold, and from suspense asto when they would march into Canada the troops began to hope thatorders would come from Washington to retire into winter-quarters. Oneparticularly cold, rainy evening, Morton retired to rest in a moodthat was in keeping with his dismal surroundings, and courted sleep togive him temporary relief. How long he might have been lost in slumberhe was unconscious, when awakened by something lightly passing overhis face. “Keep quiet,” said a voice: “do not cry or you may attractthe guard.” The darkness was intense; the patter of the rain on theroof the only sound without. The voice Morton recognized at once asHemlock’s.“How did you get here? Do you not know they would tear you limb fromlimb if they found you?”“I know it all, but an Indian brave counts nothing when he goes to savea friend. Get up and go with me.”A momentary feeling of exultation fluttered in Morton’s breast at theprospect of liberty, followed by the depressing recollection that hehad given his word not to escape.“I cannot go with you,” he said in a voice of despair.“Why? You are well of your hurt, and you can run a mile or two if weare followed. Come, my arm will help you.”“Hemlock, had you come a fortnight ago I would have jumped at yourcall: I cannot tonight, for I have given my word of honor not toescape. I am a prisoner on parole.”“Honor! Did these Americans treat you as men of honor, when they putthe rope round your neck? Your promise is nothing. Come!”“I cannot, Hemlock. Let them be what they may, it shall never be saidthat a British officer broke his word. Leave me; get away at once, oryou may be caught.”“I will not leave without you. Think of the fair doe that sorrows insecret by the Chateaugay for you and sought me out to bring you. Come,you shall be with her before another sun has set.”Morton was puzzled by this speech, but was too anxious concerningHemlock’s safety to delay by asking what it meant.“Save yourself, Hemlock; the patrol will be round soon, and if you arediscovered you are lost.”“I fear not: they cannot take me alive.”“For my sake, then, go; I will not leave, I will keep the promise Ihave given. Consider this my friend, if you are found here it is deathto me as well as you. Go.”“Not without you; I will carry you on my back, whether you will ornot,” and he laid his hand upon Morton to grasp hold of him. At thatmoment, the sound of the tramp of an approaching detachment ofsoldiers was heard. “It is the patrol, Hemlock; fly for God’s sake.”Hemlock stepped to the door for an instant, then turning to Mortonwhispered, “they have torches and will see what I have done, and thatwill give the alarm. Come, go with me.”“I cannot,” said Morton decisively.“Then, give me a token to show her who sent me that I did my duty,”said Hemlock. Eager for his escape, Morton plucked the signet-ringfrom his finger and pressed it into the Indian’s hand with a farewellgrasp. Noiselessly and swiftly Hemlock glided out, across the open,and was lost to sight. Seeing how near the patrol were, Morton closedthe door and lay down upon his bed of straw. He heard the tramp ofthe troops draw nearer, and then a sharp cry of “Halt!” followed bya shout of horror and a volley of curses. “The damned Indians areabout!” a voice cried. “Poor Tom,” said another, “he died like a stuckpig.” “See to the Britisher,” shouted a third, “he must know of it.”“Back to your ranks,” commanded the officer, “I will see to what is tobe done.” Sending a messenger to headquarters to report, he detailedthree others to approach the stable and bring out Morton. One of thethree remonstrated. “The redskin may be hiding there and kill us.”“Obey orders,” yelled the officer to his men, who had peculiar ideas ofmilitary obedience. “Our muskets cover you.”Reluctantly they approached, and two simultaneously burst in the doorwith a rush, while the third held a torch. Their only discovery wasMorton lying in his bed. He was roughly dragged to the captain, who,with his men, stood around something stretched upon the grass.“What do you know of this, prisoner?” asked the captain, and a soldierwaved a torch over the object. Morton, with a shudder, perceived it wasthe body of a soldier that had been stabbed in the breast, and scalped.“This body is warm,” said the captain, “the deed has been done withina quarter of an hour: you lay within 20 yards of its perpetration; Idemand what you know of the slaughter of this sentry of the UnitedStates army.”Morton hesitated. He had no moral doubt that Hemlock had committedthe deed, and that the scalp of the dead man was then dangling fromhis belt, and in his horror of the act was about to tell all, when hesuddenly recollected that by doing so he would show himself ungratefulto Hemlock.“I neither saw nor heard aught of this foul murder,” answered Morton,but his hesitation in replying was noted by men disposed to suspecthim. “Let me put my bayonet through him,” said one of the soldiers withan oath, as he rushed upon Morton. There was a flash from the adjoiningbush, the crack of a rifle, and the soldier fell dead, with a bullet inhis forehead.“Out with the lights,” shrieked the captain in a transport of fear,as he struck one torch down with his sword and the others were throwninto the pools of rainwater. For a minute or two they listened withpalpitating hearts in the darkness, and then the captain whisperedfor them to move to headquarters, the lights of which were seen nearby. Forgotten by them in their alarm, Morton made his way back to thestable and flung himself down on his pallet of straw, perplexed andagitated. In vain he tried to sleep and the night dragged wearilyon. When daylight at last began to dawn upon a scene of sullen rainand sodden fields, the sound of voices told him his captors were onthe alert. The door was violently opened and a soldier looked in andreported to his comrades outside, “The varmint is still here,” to whichhe heard the reply, “That beats me!” An hour later a scout entered,lighted a candle, and proceeded to examine the floor of the stable andits contents. When he was done, the door was bolted and, Morton feltassured, a sentry placed outside. Breakfast time passed without hiscaterer appearing and the forenoon was well advanced before he wasdisturbed, when a detachment of troops halted and an officer entered.“I have come, Mr Morton, to take you to headquarters.”Going out, Morton was placed between files and marched to the General’squarters, where he was shown into a room where several officers wereseated. Motioned to stand at the foot of the table, the presidingofficer, a tall, cadaverous man, asked him to tell what he knew of theevent of the past night.“Is this a court-martial and am I on trial?”“No, it is a committee of enquiry. There ain’t no call for trying you,seein’ you are already a condemned culprit.”“Then, why should I answer you?”“Wall, if you make a clean breast of it, we mought recommend theGeneral to commute your sentence.”“And should I not see fit to answer this irregular tribunal?”“I ain’t going to knock round the bush with you. At home, everybodyknows Major Spooner as up-and-down, frank and square, and I tell you,if you don’t spit out all you know, the rope won’t be taken off yourneck a second time.”“What I know of last night’s shocking event I am ready to communicateto any gentleman who approaches me in an honorable manner, but I scornto say a word under threats.”The officers here exchanged nods and winks, and one said: “I knewMister President, he wouldn’t tell--he dassn’t. He had a hand inkilling Jackson--gagged his mouth, mebbe, while the redskin drew hisknife.”Morton, stung to the quick, turned indignantly to the speaker, “Sir, ifI had my sword you would either take back your words or know what coldsteel is.”“Pshaw,” was the contemptuous retort, “I don’t care for anything in theshape of a Britisher.”“That’s so, and you know first-rate how to rile one,” exclaimed thepresiding officer approvingly. Then addressing Morton, he added, “Weain’t afeared of your threats, young man, and won’t lose time withyou--yes or no, are you going to give evidence?”“No,” answered Morton firmly.“That will do: withdraw the prisoner.”“Excuse me, Major Spooner,” said a voice behind. Morton turned andsaw standing by the door an officer whose bearing indicated he was asoldier by profession and not one of a few months’ standing. “I came inafter the examination had begun and therefore did not take my seat atthe board. If you will allow me, I will endeavor to represent to theaccused how matters stand.”“Sartainly, Colonel Vanderberg; yer ken try him.”“Then, Mr Morton, the case stands thus: last night one of our men onguard, posted near where you slept, was stabbed and scalped. I neednot say, I do not believe for a moment you had any hand in that deed.However, this morning experts were sent to discover the trail of theperpetrator, and they, favored by the softness of the soil, traced thesteps of the moccasined feet of an Indian to where the guard stood,thence to your lodging-place and finally from it to the bush whencecame the shot that killed one of the patrol. More than all this, I maytell you the footmarks of the Indian are plain inside the stable andbeside the place in it where you slept are marks caused by drops ofblood. It is thus beyond all question that the Indian visited you, and,with a view to discovering him and so checking a system of barbarouswarfare repulsive to all true soldiers, we ask you to tell us what youknow of him--ask you, not under threats or taking advantage of yourunfortunate position, but as a gentleman and a soldier to assist us bytelling what you know of the mysterious affair.”Morton bowed to the Colonel and replied he had no hesitation intelling him what he knew, and he recounted briefly how he had beenawakened during the night by an Indian and urged to fly with him.He was prepared to take oath that he knew not of his slaying theguard, and the drops of blood upon the straw that formed his bedmust have dripped from the scalp as the Indian stooped over him andurged him to accompany him. Morton mentioned no name, and none of hisquestioners seemed to think he could have known the Indian. At anyrate their incredulity of his story, verging on disgust, renderedcross-questioning superfluous, Major Spooner said he could not swallowthe yarn, and another officer remarked it would be easier for him to gowithout his bitters for a month than believe a Britisher would not runaway when he had a chance, to which the others agreed.“What!” exclaimed Morton, “do you think, after giving my word of honorto your General that I would not attempt to escape, that I would do so?”“That is just what we do think, and that there was something we don’tknow of that kept you from running away with the Indian.”Morton’s anger again rose and he was about to say something rash, whenColonel Vanderberg gave his shoulder a monitory touch. “If none of youobject, I will take charge of Mr Morton.”“Yer welkim to the critter,” remarked Major Spooner, at which theothers expectorated in order to laugh. “He is under sentence of death,and it lies with the General to say when it shall be carried out. Ifhe is willing you should undertake the provost-marshal’s duty, thiscommittee of enquiry offer you their congratulations.”To this raillery Colonel Vanderberg said naught, and taking Morton bythe arm led him into a vacant room. “Stay here for a minute,” he said.On re-entering he grasped Morton by the hand, while he informed him“the General has given me permission to take you with me, and will youride with me to Fort Hickory?”“With all my heart,” answered Morton, and going to the door foundseveral troopers waiting the Colonel, who pointed to Morton to get onthe back of one of three spare horses. He did so and they galloped outof the village.CHAPTER IX.Maggie was busy with household duties when Hemlock entered and sat downnear the table at which she stood.“All away?” he asked.“All except mother, who is having her afternoon nap.”Casting a suspicious glance round, the Indian drew something out of hispouch. “Do you know that?”It was a ring. Maggie examined it and as she recognized whose it was,blushed.“Is he alive?” she asked, in a low earnest tone, as if fearful that itwas a memorial gift.“Yes; I was with him and spoke to him night before last.”“Where?”“At Four Corners.”“Tell me all?” entreated Maggie, and Hemlock recounted his visit,closing with the remark, “If he had come with me, he would have beenhere now.”“But he would have broken his word to the Yankees,” urged Maggie in hisdefence.“And perhaps they will break his neck,” answered Hemlock with a grunt.“Major Stovin told me that Hampton’s answer to his letter was that hecould allow no interference from outside in his disposal of spies.”“Morton is not a spy,” exclaimed Maggie indignantly.“They will punish him all the same unless I give myself up,” saidHemlock, “and I mean to.”“Oh, Hemlock, they would kill you.”“Maybe, but Indian would save his friend.”“He may get off when our men beat them.”The Indian’s lip curled. “The owls are telling the eagles what to do.When the order came to the Indian bands not to fight but just watch,I left. We would have hung to their sides like wasps on a deer, andmarked every mile they marched with deeds that would have caused widowsto raise the funeral song from Champlain to the Ohio, but our arms areheld fast.”“You did not tell me how you came by this ring?” faltered Maggie, asshe shyly tried it on her fingers.“I asked him for a token, and he gave me that.”“A token for whom, Hemlock?”“For you.”“For me!” gasped Maggie, with beaming eyes, while her color came andwent.Hemlock nodded and said no more. Turning her head away from him, Maggiepressed the token to her lips. On the Indian’s rising to go, sheentreated him to stay. Her brothers were at the camp, but her fatherwas only at the rear end of the lot stooking corn, and he might go andsee him. Hemlock, who had the dislike of his race to manual labor, saidhe would wait, and catching up the fishing-rod of her younger brother,prepared it to beguile the denizens of the river that flowed past theshanty, and continued fishing until the old man returned, who sat downbeside Hemlock and got into an engrossing conversation, which was endedby Maggie’s calling them to supper. When the meal was fairly under way,the father said:“Hemlock wants us to leave. He says the Americans will be here in a dayor two. He offers to bring Indians with enough of canoes to take youand Maggie to Montreal.”“Leave my hame for thae Yankees!” exclaimed Mrs Forsyth; “no a stepwill I gang oot o’ my way for the deils.”“Hemlock says they may burn down the house and insult you, an’ ye wadbe better oot o’ their way.”“I wad like to see the Yankee loon that wad try to set a low to oor bitbiggin; I wad ding some dacency into his heid.”“Think o’ Maggie, guid wife.”Before her mother could speak, Maggie declared “she wasna fear’t an’wad bide wi’ her mither, thankin’ Hemlock a’ the same.”“You see, Hemlock, hoo wi’ Scotch bodies stick by our hames. Down tothe women and bairns, we will fecht to the last gasp to haud them.”Hemlock said nothing and helped himself to another piece ofjohnny-cake. The subject, however, had excited Mrs Forsyth, who mingleddenunciations of the invaders with regrets at leaving Scotland.“Toots, woman, Canada is a better country for the puir man thanScotlan.”“I am no denyin’ that, but eh, there was a couthie security therethat’s no here, an’ for a sicht o’ its bonnie howes an’ glens I’d gieonything. The first an’ the last sicht each day frae my faither’s doorwas the Pentlands, an’ no trees, trees, wi’ snaw an’ ice hauf the year.”“Ye wadna gae back, mither, for a’ that.”“Deed would I, gin we a’ went the gither.”“But ye have aften tell’t me ye wad never cross the sea again, ye wereso sick in coming.”“Na, neither I wad; nae boatie for me.”“Then, ye canna gang.”“Hoot, lass, what are ye sayin’; is that a’ ye ken? We could walkroun’.”“Providence, dear wife, has cast oor lot here an’ it’s oor duty tobe content. Please God, we will help to mak o’ Canada a country oorchildren will be proud o’, an as for thae Yankees, wha come to rob uso’ oor liberty, I am sure their conceit will lead to their fa’ an’ thattheir designs upon us will come to naething.”Hemlock rose and prepared to leave. “I will go with you,” saidForsyth, “and hear what is the news in the camp.”Getting into the canoe they arrived at the forks in due time, and foundgreat activity in erecting buildings, while carts were arriving everyfew minutes from the Basin with supplies or leaving empty to reload.In every direction were soldiers encamped, and the evening being coldtheir fires crackled and blazed along the lines. The soldiers wereof all kinds, from habitants in homespun blouses and blue tuques toregulars of the line. The noisiest were the volunteer regiments,composed of young men, lumbermen and city tradesmen, whose exuberantanimal spirits the discomforts and privations of camp failed to tame,and where they were, screams, laughter, and singing resounded. Hemlockled the way to a large, white house, the home of an American settler,named Baker, but taken possession of for headquarters, and passing theguard as a privileged character, told the orderly he wanted to see theGeneral. On enquiry, the two visitors were admitted into a good-sizedroom, in the centre of which was a large table, at which sat athick-set officer of foreign aspect, Gen. deWatteville, his secretary,and Major Henry, who had succeeded Stovin as local commander. They wereevidently engaged in examining regimental reports.“Hemlock, so you have got back? What news from the lines?” asked theMajor.“Yankees will break camp tomorrow.”“How do you know? Have you any despatches from our spies?”“No, but I saw a waggon loaded with axes arrive at Fort Hickory.”“Well, what about that?”“The advance camp, nearest to here, is called Fort Hickory: the axesare to chop a road from there to our outposts on the Chateaugay.”DeWatteville became all attention. “How long would the road be?”“Three leagues,” answered Hemlock.“Pooh,” remarked the General, relapsing into indifference, “they cannotcut a road that long through the woods.”“You don’t know Yankee axemen,” said Hemlock, “they will do it in a dayand turn your flank.”The General simply waved his hand contemptuously. Major Henry, knowingfrom past acquaintance, Hemlock’s worth and intelligence, asked in arespectful tone, “What do you advise?”“Send me with all the Indians and we will cut them off.”DeWatteville could not withhold a gesture of horror. “You would fallupon these axemen, you say are coming, butcher them with your hatchetsand scalp them. Eh?”“Every one of them,” answered Hemlock in an exultant voice.“Faugh, that is not war; that is murder,” said the General, “we willfight the Americans in no such way.”“It is how they would deal with you,” said Hemlock, “but if you do notwant the Indian to fight in the way of his fathers, he will leave you.”Henry here leant over and whispered into the General’s ear; whoanswered aloud, “No, I will not hear of it: I will fight as a soldierand will have no savagery.” The Major was evidently disconcerted, andchanged the subject by asking Hemlock what led him so far from thelines as to visit Fort Hickory.“I followed Morton.”“Ha!” exclaimed the General, “poor fellow, what of him?”“They were going to hang him, when Colonel Vanderberg took him fromFour Corners.”“You see, General,” said Major Henry with a smile, “the savagery of theinvader against whom you would not use the services of Hemlock and hisbraves in self-defence.”The General twirled his heavy grey mustache and bit it nervously. “Ifthey hang him, I will let every redskin in the country loose upon them.”“It would serve Morton better to do so before the rope does its work,”suggested the Major. “Our remonstrances addressed to General Hamptonhave been met with combined equivocation and insolence. ‘Give up,’ hesays, ‘the murderer of Major Slocum and I will set Morton at liberty.’As much as to say we screen the murderer--a man I know nothing of andfor whose deed His Majesty’s service is not accountable.”Hemlock said, “Read that again?”Taking up General Hampton’s despatch in answer to that regardingMorton’s treatment, the Major read it in full. The Indian listenedintently and made no comment, but Forsyth said quietly, he was sure MrMorton had no hand in murdering anybody.“We all know that,” answered Major Henry, “a more humane and yet a moregallant officer the King has not got. And now, Forsyth, what are youand the settlers going to do when the Americans cross the frontier?”“Ye’ll excuse me for saying so, but that is a silly question to ask o’men wha hae gien their sons to serve as sogers and placed their horses,and a’ their barns and cellars contain at your service.”“You don’t understand me. I mean do you intend staying in your housesshould the enemy come, or will you seek safety in Montreal?”“It wad be hard to gie up to the destroyer all we hae and that wehae gaithered wi’ sic pains in years gane by. My ain mind is, and myneebors agree, that we will stand by our property an’ tak chances.”“It is the resolve of brave men,” remarked the General, “but it may bein the interest of the campaign to waste the country and leave neithersupplies nor shelter for the enemy.”“Gin sic should prove the case,” answered the farmer, “there’s no anAuld Countryman on the river that wadna pit the fire to his biggin wi’his ain hand. Gear is guid, but independence is sweet.”“I hope you will not be asked to make such a sacrifice,” said theMajor, “we have reports here of reinforcements on the way that, if theyarrive in time, will enable us to meet the enemy.”The General here intimated to them to retire. Hemlock started as iffrom a reverie. Going close to the General, he stretched out his righthand after the manner of Indian orators. “You meet the Yankees assoldier meets soldier. The red man meets them as the robbers of hislands, the destroyers of his villages, the slayers of his race. Theland was ours, and they have driven us to the setting sun and left usnot even standing-room for our lodges. You have called us savages. Whomade us savages? The Indian forgets no kindness and forgives no wrong.The hand that has despoiled and struck at us, we will seek late andearly, in light and dark, to smite. Our enemy for generations, theenemy we are always at war with, is your enemy today. You may makepeace with him tomorrow. We never will. When the Indian dies, he giveshis hatchet to his sons. We offer you our help. Tell me to go and dowhat I will, and the Americans will not drink of the St Lawrence. Tenscore Iroquois will keep up the war-whoop along the frontier until theyturn.”The General seemed annoyed and said sharply, “We take you as scouts,not as comrades-in-arms. I will have no barbarian warfare.”Hemlock drew himself up with dignity as he said: “We are your allies,not your hirelings. Our tribes declared war against the Americansbefore you did, and if you will not accept our aid we withdraw thisnight from your camp and shall fight on our own hand.”Major Henry perceived the mistake made by the General and hastened toundo it. “King George,” he said, “is true to the treaty made with hisIndian allies and I am sure you will stand by it too. The General ispreparing his plans for receiving the Americans and the Indians willhave their place in it.”Without apparently heeding these words, Hemlock approached close to theGeneral. “I warn you,” he said, “if you reject our aid, great soldieras you may be across the sea, in the warfare of these woods your lightwill go out like this,” and with a wave of his hand he put out thelight of one of the two candles on the table. Turning on his heel, hewalked with stately stride out of the room. That night he and his bandleft the camp and ceased to receive orders from headquarters.CHAPTER X.“Well, Morton, our days of inglorious idleness are ended,” exclaimedCol. Vanderberg. “I return from headquarters with orders for animmediate advance.”“Thank heavens!” ejaculated Morton.“What! Do you rejoice at an attack on your country? Come, my goodfriend, I see your judgment is overcoming your feelings, and you aregoing to cast in your lot with us--the latest convert from monarchismto republicanism.”“No, no: you need not banter me. What I rejoice at is the ending ofa policy of inaction that has kept you, my friend, and your humbleprisoner alike in wearisome suspense.”“It is ended: the die is cast, whatever the result may be. After dinnersquads of men begin to chop out a road from Smith’s, and tomorrow Izardcomes with reinforcements and under him we bear the banner of theUnited States into Canada.”“And what do you propose doing with me when you advance?” asked Morton.“Hum! To leave you behind means your being returned to Four Corners,with a chance of meeting the fate you twice escaped. It is againstall military rule, but you must go with us. I will not risk you in thehands of these legal Sons of Mars--Spooner et al.”“Thank you, Colonel; again you have placed me under an obligation I cannever repay.”“I hope not,” answered the Colonel with a smile, “I’d rather not be HisMajesty’s prisoner even with Lieutenant Morton as my custodian.”“No, never; I wish to pay my debt of gratitude in no such way.”“Say no more, Morton, on that score. The happiest days I have spentthis summer have been since I made your acquaintance. If I did you agood turn, I have had compensation. And now to work: there comes awaggon creaking under its load of chopping axes.”The conversation took place at an outpost of Hampton’s army, closeupon the frontier, styled Douglas camp in official documents but knownfamiliarly among the soldiers as Fort Hickory, from the character ofthe trees that prevailed at this spot. Colonel Vanderberg, instead ofplacing Morton in custody as he half anticipated, when he dismountedafter his ride from Four Corners, took him into the house where hewas quartered, and told him in few words he was again on parole andhis guest. Without farther allusion to the humiliating and perilousposition from which he had snatched him, Col. Vanderberg made himhis friend and associate and each passing day strengthened the bondbetween them. Each had experiences of interest to the other. TheColonel had tales of peril on the Pennsylvania and Ohio frontiers inprotecting the settlements from Indian attacks, and Morton, in return,gratified his curiosity as to the organization and character of theBritish army and English life and habits.The following morning they had breakfast by candle-light, and on goingout, found the camp in a flurry of preparation, troopers ready tomount, engineers with their tools over their shoulders, and a largesquad of brawny fellows in flannel shirts with axe in hand, draftedfrom the various corps and hired from among the surrounding farmers toclear a road to the Chateaugay. All was life, bustle, and confusion.Jumping on horseback, the Colonel speedily got each man into his place,and by the time this was effected, the drum-taps, by which they keptstep, of Izard’s column were heard, and that officer gave the word toadvance. Preceded by a squad of scouts and sharp-shooters to coverthem, the engineers and axemen moved on, then a body of infantry,followed by the troopers, a few commissariat wagons bringing up therear. The Colonel and Morton were with the troopers. As the long andpicturesque cavalcade scrambled over the brow of a hill, the sun hadgained the ascendency, and the frost that had whitened everything nowsparkled on every stem and leaf as it melted in the sunbeams. Theatmosphere was clear and crisp, and the very odor that rose from thefallen leaves added to its exhilarating quality. When the summit of theascent was reached, the declivity was abrupt enough to afford a lookoutover the tree-tops, and Canada lay outstretched a vast plain at theirfeet. Far in the distance, could be seen a gleaming line, like a rapierflung across a brown cloak. It was the St Lawrence. The Colonel drewhis horse to one side of the road, to permit the troops to pass, whilehe scanned the inspiring scene.“All looks peaceful,” he said to Morton, “no sign that under the coverof these woods an enemy awaits us.”“It is a grand view of a noble country,” replied Morton, “and you mayrely on it, there are men awaiting you who will shed the last drop oftheir blood in its defence.”The Colonel, drawing his bridle, joined in the march and the glimpseof Canada was lost under overhanging vistas of trees. “Do you know,Morton,” he said, “it seems strange to me that our armies should meetresistance from the Canadians. We speak the same language; we are ofthe same stock. Why should they fight to the death against uniting withus as equal partners in a free government?”“You forget, Colonel, that speech and origin are not the strongestelements in national sentiment. You meet a woman with a big mansupporting her and bearing himself as if he were proud of her, andyou wonder at it, and say the man could find plenty whose faces arepleasanter to look upon and which indicate more intelligence. The manwill admit all that, but he tells you the woman is his mother, and tohim she is better and more beautiful than all the women in the worldbeside. In the same way, the British government may be inferior insome points to your new Republic, may have made mistakes in the past,and might be better in some regards, but then she is the mother of theCanadians, and they will not desert her for bouncing Miss Columbia.”“That won’t do, Morton; you forget that the British government wasonce, as you term it, our mother also.”“I did not forget that, and I hope I will not offend you, Colonel, bysaying that for that very cause the Canadians dislike Americans. Youturned upon your mother, you strove to compass her humiliation; thevery base of your patriotic feeling is hatred of her.”“That is putting it strong, Morton.”“I think not; the preamble of your declaration of independence is atirade of gratuitous charges against Great Britain.”“Then you think Canada will never unite with the Republic?”“I certainly think so, and those who live to see it, will find twogreat English-speaking communities on this continent, with this radicaldifference between them, that one reviles and seeks to injure themother-land from which they sprung and the other succors and honorsher.”A commotion in front stopped the conversation and two scouts were seendragging an old man between them towards the Colonel.“What’s this?” he asked sharply.“We have taken a prisoner!” cried one of the men in an exulting voice.“The divil take you,” interrupted the old man with contentious manner.“Yees had no business wid me.”“We found him hiding behind some brush watching our men. He is a spy,”said the scout.“Behind some brush! An’ whose brush was it? Me own, bedad.”“You had no business there.”“No business to be on my own farrum! Bad scran to ye, if I had yees inWixford I’d get the constable to arrist every man o’ yees for trispass.”“Come, hold your tongue,” said a scout roughly.“Hould yer own whisht. Ye havn’t mended yer manners since I saw yerbacks at Brandywine.”Col. Vanderberg smiled as he said to the scouts, “I am afraid youhave been too hasty. We are now in Canada and must not molest itsinhabitants. The old man is a non-combatant, and, as he declares, wason his own farm when taken.”“If you had seen him kick and scratch and wriggle when we put handsupon him, you wouldn’t say he was a non-combatant, Colonel. He sworeat the United States and said he kept one of our flags for hispocket-handkerchief.”“Tut, tut,” exclaimed the Colonel, “we have not come to fight old men;let him go.”“Ye’d betther,” remarked the old man with a grin, “or I’ll make yesorry.”“Now, what could you do?” asked the Colonel with an amused smile.The old man sidled up beside the bridle of the Colonel’s horse, and ina tone of mock solemnity, while his eyes sparkled with fun, whispered,“I’d put the curse of Cramwell an ye.”“Say, friend,” said Morton, “there is something about you that tells meyou are an old soldier. Were you ever in the army?”“Yis, but not in yer riffraff that ye’s call an army.”“You are mistaken in me,” replied Morton, and drawing aside his cloakshowed the scarlet coat of the British service.“An’ how did ye fall in wid dem rebels? A prisoner are ye, God saveus! You’ll be Leftenant Morton that was to be hanged, as I heard tell.Well, well, since ye wern’t born to be hanged, it is drownded ye maybe. Av coorse I was in the army an’ got me discharge an’ a grant ofland from King George, an’ may the divil catch a hould o’ dem thatdon’t wish him well.”“Are all your neighbors of the same mind?” asked the Colonel.“They are that same. Come wid me to my shanty an’ while I sind for ’im,you will have an illigant dinner of praties an’ milk. There is not wanon the frontier that does not say with Capt. Barron, God bless the Kingan’ canfound his inimies.”“Thank you,” answered the Colonel, “but I have other fish to fry today.Tell me this, old man, What difference would it make to you and yourneighbors that you should eat your potatoes and milk under the Starsand Stripes instead of the Union Jack?”“Sure, that’s aisy answered. The differ between atin’ in an inimy’shouse an’ aitin’ in yer awn.”“Come, Morton, we lose time. Good-bye, old man,” and putting spursto his horse the Colonel galloped to regain his place in the column,followed by Morton.By noon the scouts had reached the Chateaugay, which they fordedwithout hesitation and advancing on a shanty that stood on the bank,surprised its inmates, a party of Canadian volunteers on outpostduty, while taking an afternoon nap. This capture was of advantage tothe Americans, for it delayed by several hours intelligence of theirinvasion being received at the British headquarters. Shortly afterwardsCol. Vanderberg arrived, who, without halting for refreshment,accompanied Gen. Izard down the river some distance, examining thecountry. On returning, men were set to work to prepare a camp for themain army, which he knew was on the march. A thorough soldier, welltrained in bush fighting, the Colonel made his arrangements with anacumen and decision that increased Morton’s regard for him. Beforesunset a line of scouts was established across the valley, a stronglyfortified post established, tents pitched, and a messenger sent with adespatch to Hampton informing him all was ready. Not until then, didthe Colonel divest himself of his long-boots and draw up beside thelog-fire of the shanty of one Spears to discuss the fare his servanthad provided.CHAPTER XI.On the morning after the events narrated in preceding chapter, GeneralHampton left his quarters at Four Corners for the new camp. Escorted by20 cavalrymen, he and his staff rode rapidly over the newly-cut road,and by noon reached the Chateaugay. Halting on the bluff that overlooksthe junction of the Outard with that river, and whence he had fullview of the camp in busy preparation on the other side of the river,he awaited the arrival of his tents. A stout man and well-advanced inyears, the exertion of the journey had fatigued him, and he sat, orrather reclined, on a log in front of a blazing fire, for the day waschilly, and grouped around him were the officers of his staff. At thefoot of the bank and in the near distance, were the troopers tendingtheir horses and the officers’ servants preparing dinner.From his elevated position, the General had a full view of the oppositebank and he watched with complacency the arrival at the new camp, withflutter of flag and tuck of drum, of frequent detachments.“Everything bodes favorably for our enterprise,” he remarked, “thedespatches that awaited me tell of unprecedented success. At everypoint attempted our battalions have entered the enemy’s territoryunopposed and advanced unmolested. The Rubicon has been crossed andterror-stricken the foe flies before us. This afternoon a specialmessenger shall bear to Albany, New York and Washington the tidings ofour triumphant progress--of our undisputed taking possession of thiscountry to which the British authorities make a pretended claim.”“Your despatch will cause great rejoicing,” said an officer.“Yes, it will be hailed with loud acclaim, and my enemies who clamoredagainst me, will now perceive that what they stigmatized as inactionwas the profoundest strategy. Sixteen miles have we marched into theenemy’s territory and not a hostile bayonet has been seen. Ha, who isthis? Draw your swords.”All eyes turned in the direction of the General’s, and a tall Indianwas seen standing immovably beside a giant pine. It was Hemlock. As heremained motionless with folded arms, and was apparently unarmed, theofficers got over their alarm, and those who had laid their hands upontheir swords, dropped them.“Sirrah, what do you here? How passed you our guards?” shouted theGeneral.“I have come to speak with you. You are ten to one; your escort iswithin hail of you, will you listen to me?”“Go on,” said Hampton.“You have a British officer held as prisoner. You wrote to Major Stovinthat you would set him free if the Indian who killed Slocum were givenin exchange. Do you stand by that offer?”“Morton goes free when the Indian is sent in.”“Give me an order for his release; the Indian goes to your camp atonce.”“That will not do, Mr Redskin. The exchange must be effected throughthe British commander. Let him send an accredited officer with a flagof truce and we will treat with him.”“Before that can be done, Morton may be dead. If you get the Indianwhat care you for else? The Indian who killed Slocum passes into yourhands the moment Morton is given liberty.”“This is altogether irregular,” remarked an officer, “General Hamptoncannot deal with an irresponsible redskin, who, for all he knows,has come here on some scheme of deviltry. See here, was it you thatmurdered Slocum?”“I never murdered any man,” answered Hemlock proudly, “but I havekilled many in war. Had you the Indian who slew him, what would you doto him?”“Well, I guess, if the General let us have our way, we would hand himto the men of Slocum’s old regiment and they’d make him wish he hadnever been born.”“The Indian might have had good cause for dealing with Slocum as hedid?”“No, you red devil, he could have no cause. He carved him up out ofpure deviltry.”“You are tired, General,” said Hemlock, with a courteous wave of thehand, “and while you rest, will you listen to me, for I have heardthat Indian’s story? In the Mohawk valley lived an English family whenyou Americans rose against King George. A neighbor, who had come fromMassachusetts, envied their farm, and, on the Englishman refusing toforswear his allegiance, had it confiscated and took possession. TheEnglishman had to fly and went through the woods, many days’ journey toCanada, guided by a band of loyal Oneidas. When they reached Canada,a young warrior of that band stayed with them and helped them to findfood in the wilderness until crops grew. That Indian gave up his tribe,and lived with them and a daughter came to love him, and they weremarried and were happy many years, until the mist rose from the lakeand she sickened and died. The Indian so loved her that he would havekilled himself to follow her to the spirit land, had she not left adaughter, who was his joy and life. When she grew up, the Indian said,She shall be the equal of the best, and he took her to Albany to betaught all ladies learn. A young man saw her, met her, learned of theIndian blood in her veins, and doomed her as his spoil. He was aidedby a companion in deceiving her by a false marriage, she lived withhim for a while, was cast off, and her deceiver married the governor’sdaughter. The Indian had gone on a far journey; he went to seek forfurs in the West to get money for his daughter. In two years he came toMontreal with many canoe-loads, he sold them, he went to Albany, andfound his child dying of a broken heart. He took her away with him, henursed her by the Ottawa--he buried her there. He went back to Albany,and was told the law could not punish Slocum or his friend, who hadgone away. Then he sought Slocum and twenty times he could have killedhim, but he would not. In his heart he said, Slocum must die not by theknife or bullet, but by torture, and the chance came not until a moonago, when he met Slocum face to face in the Chateaugay woods about tostab Morton. The Indian took Slocum, and for hours he made him feelpart of the pain he had caused him and his child--only a part, for youwho are fathers can guess what that Indian and his daughter suffered.Was that Indian to blame? Did he do more to him than he deserved? Willyou give the father over to Slocum’s soldiers to be abused and killed?”“A good yarn,” remarked an officer, “and a true one, for I lived atAlbany then and saw the girl; pretty as a picture and simple as a baby.If Major Slocum had not got his hand in first, some other fellow wouldand she would have been made a fool of anyway.”“We will have nigger fathers running after us next,” sneered anotherofficer.“Did you know Slocum?” asked Hemlock of the first who had spoken, witha quaver in his voice he could not control.“Guess I did. Slocum and Spooner were chums in those days, and by----, I believe you are the father of the young squaw you make such abother about. Won’t we hold him, General?” So saying he rose, as ifwaiting his assent to seize Hemlock. Before he could take a secondstep, Hemlock, with a quick motion, snatched his tomahawk, which he hadconcealed in his bosom, threw it, and leapt into the bush, where he waslost to sight in a moment. The officer, without uttering a word, fellon his back; the head of the tomahawk buried in his forehead. Stunnedby the event, the officers lost a few minutes in giving the alarm. Whensearch was made, it was in vain; Hemlock had not left a trace behindhim.       *       *       *       *       *The evening set in dismal and rainy, with a raw east wind that made thesoldiers seek every available shelter. In the Forsyth household therewas the alarm natural to the knowledge that the invaders were withina short distance, but the daily routine of duty was not interruptedand everything had gone on as usual. All had retired to rest exceptMaggie, who sat before the fire, building castles in the flickeringflames and dying embers. While so engaged, the door, never fastened,opened softly, and Hemlock stepped in. Regardless of his soddengarments, he crouched beside the girl, without uttering a word. “Do youbring news of the coming of the enemy?” she whispered.“No: they are shivering in their tents.”“It is a cruel night to be out of doors.”The Indian nodded assent, and relapsed into silence. “Maggie,” he saidsuddenly, “I may have to leave Morton to your care.”“Dear me, Hemlock, what can I do?”“I have done everything,” he went on to say, “that I could. I gavehim a chance to escape from his prison and today I offered Hampton tosurrender the Indian they want in exchange for him and he refused. Hewill treat with the British General alone.”“That is surely easy, Hemlock. When the Yankees say they will give upMr Morton for the Indian they blame for murdering their officer, ourGeneral will be glad to give up the Indian, provided he can be got.”“No: our General refuses, saying it would be an unheard of thing forthe British to give up an ally for an act of warfare, and he will notlisten to the Yankee demand.”“May be he says that because he cannot get the Indian,” suggestedMaggie.“I am the Indian,” said Hemlock curtly, “and I asked him to bind meand send me to the American camp with a flag of truce, and all he saidwas, ‘He would sooner hear of Morton being hung than be guilty of suchtreachery to a faithful ally.’”“My, Hemlock! What made you be so cruel? That you have a feeling heartI know, for I have seen you cry over your daughter’s----”With a quick gesture Hemlock stopped her.“Speak no more of that. It was because of my love for my child that Itortured the wretch to death.” Here he paused, his features workingwith emotions that cast them into frightful contortions. “Oh, Maggie, Ithought if I could have my revenge I’d be happy. I had my heart’s wishon the spoiler of my child and today I brained the villain that helpedhim, and I am more miserable than ever. My vengeance has done me nogood. My child, my daughter, oh come to me!”The heart of Maggie melted with sympathy. She rose and resting one handon his shoulder sought his with the other. “Take it not,” he said in awhisper, “it is the hand of blood.”“Hemlock, I dinna judge you as I would ane o’ oor ain folk, for thenature born with you is no like oors, let alane your upbringing, but Iken you to be an honest, and wronged man, with a kindly heart, and Iwould share your sorrow that I may lichten it.”The Indian was evidently touched. Grasping her hand he bent over itand pressed it to his lips. After a long pause, Maggie added: “If youwould give up your heathen ways and turn to the Lord, your path wouldbecome clear.”“I once followed the Lord,” said Hemlock, “I learned of Him from mywife, and I taught my daughter to love Jesus, but when the cloud cameand its darkness blinded me, I put away the white man’s God and wentback to the ways of my fathers.”“Leave them again?” entreated Maggie.“Too late: I die as I am.”“But you are no going to die, Hemlock. You’ve many years to live.”“I die before the new moon comes; my oki told me so in a dream lastnight, and that is why I have come to talk with you about Morton. Youlove him?”Too honest to utter the “no” that came to her faltering tongue,Maggie’s head drooped and her face flushed.“I know you do,” Hemlock went on, “and I know he loves you, tho’ hisheart has not told his head yet. I know not where he is; if I did, wewould attack his guard and rescue him this night. They took him awayfrom Fort Hickory and I have not got his track yet. When they findwhere he is I want you to give orders to my men when I am gone.”“This is beyond me, Hemlock.”“Listen: I have told my Indians they must save him and to obey you.”“Tell my brothers or my father.”“The Indians would not obey them: they believe what I told them, that Ihave given you my medicine. If Morton is not saved this week, he dies.”“If our men beat the Yankees will they not rescue him?”“Yankees would shoot him before they would let him escape, and theywill hang him if they retreat. They have let him live hoping to get me;when they know they cannot, they will kill him.”Maggie shuddered. “And what am I to do?”Hemlock answered: “The Indian has a good hand but a poor head. Whenthey come and tell you they have found where Morton is kept, you willorder them when and how to make the attack and into the messenger’shand you will press this medicine, and tell him it will make successsure.” Here he took a pouch from his breast and selected a smallpackage--something sewed up in a bit of bird’s skin.“I hope you will live to save your friend yourself,” said Maggie.Hemlock gloomily shook his head, and rising walked towards the door,which he opened and stepped out into the cheerless night. Maggiefollowed and looked out. She could see nothing: he was gone. That nightshe rested all the more comfortably, from knowing that within hail wasa faithful band of Indians.CHAPTER XII.Two days later Hemlock was one of a group standing on the north bank ofthe river, where it broke into a short rapid, named from the settlerwhose shanty overlooked it, Morrison’s rapid. The group includedrepresentatives of the different corps that had been gathered together,with several settlers. They were watching, in the fading twilight, athin line of moving red, emerging from the bush. It was a battalionof the Canadian Fencibles that had come from Kingston to reinforcedeWatteville. The newcomers were soon among them, brawny Highlandersfrom Glengarry, French Canadian lumbermen, and a number of farmersfrom the English settlements in the east. They were greeted with theearnestness men in peril welcome help, and assistance was given inpreparing such food as was available, while many sought rest aftertheir exhausting journey in the outbuildings of Morrison and in thesheds that had been prepared for them. Their commander, Col. Macdonell,a thin, wiry man, with a fair complexion that gave him the name ofMacdonell the Red, having seen his men disposed of, moved to the house.At the door Morrison, himself a Highlander, bade his guest welcome inthe purest of Argyllshire Gaelic, and produced his bottle. After theglass had passed round, Macdonell said, “We have come far to have atilt with the Yankees: will we be sure to meet them?”“That you will,” answered Morrison, “they are within four miles of youand will pay us a visit, maybe, the morn.”“Ha! That news does me more good than your dram. When there is fightingto be done, a Highlandman’s blood runs faster. Get us some supperready, and while we wait I’ll find out what has been done. Is therenone of the General’s staff here?”“Not an officer: they are all busy at the making of barricades; buthere is an Indian with a longer head than any of them, and who canspeak good English, which, however, is not to be compared with ourmother-language.”Resuming the use of the despised tongue--for he scorned to give Englishthe name of language--Morrison introduced Hemlock, and drawing him to acorner of the hearth, Macdonell plied him with questions. The Indian,using the ramrod of his musket, drew a plan of the country in the ashesat their feet, explaining how the Americans were encamped a few milesfarther up the river and that to get to Montreal they must go down theroad that followed its north bank. To prevent him, General deWattevillehad caused the numerous gullies of creeks where they emptied into theChateaugay, to be protected by breastworks of fallen trees, behindwhich the British would contest their advance. Six of these gullies hadbeen so prepared. In rear of them, was the main line of defence, placedwhere the ground was favorable, and strengthened by breastworks and twosmall cannon.“Aye, aye!” exclaimed Macdonell, “all very well if the Americans keepto the road: but what are we to do should they try to flank us?”The Indian’s face darkened as he whispered, “deWatteville is a good manbut he is an Old World soldier who knows nothing about bush-fighting.He would not believe me, when I told them there were bush-whackers inthe Yankee army who could march to his rear through the woods.”“That they could!” agreed the Colonel, “and where would he be then? Andwhat good would his six lines of barricades be? My own lads today cameover ground where regulars would have been bogged. Then the river canbe forded opposite this house. Could the Yankees get to this ford?”Hemlock said they could, when Macdonell answered he would see to itthat preparations were made to checkmate such a move. Finding Hemlockacute and thoroughly acquainted with the field of operations, theHighlander’s heart warmed to him as one of like soldierly instinctsas his own. Uncontaminated by the prejudice of race common to oldresidents, he had no feeling against the red-men, and when supper wasready he insisted on Hemlock’s sitting beside him, and in treating himas his equal. As the evening wore on, officers from the neighboringencampments dropped in to exchange greetings with the new-comers, andan orderly brought instructions from the General. When Hemlock left tojoin his band in their vigils along the enemy’s lines, he felt he hadnot passed so happy an evening for a dozen of years.The night passed quietly and in the morning the enemy showed nodisposition to move, so that the preparations for their receptionwent on, and the troops worked all day, the woods re-echoing thesound of their axes as they felled trees to roll into heaps to formrude breastworks. In the afternoon General de Watteville rode upand carefully inspected all that had been done, and returned to hisquarters satisfied, and altogether unwitting that the attack was to bemade from another direction in a few hours.The day had been cloudy, cheerless, and cold, and as it faded, rainbegan to fall. The men sought such cover and warmth as they could findand the officers assembled to spend the night in carousing. So raw,dark, and uninviting was it that not one in the British camp supposedthe enemy would be astir. But they were. At sunset, 1500 men left theAmerican camp, marched down to the river, forded the rapids, and begantheir march down the south bank with the intent of capturing the fordat Morrison’s at daylight.Next morning, the eventful 26th October, 1813, the Forsyths,unsuspicious of what was passing under the woods around them, were atbreakfast, when the door was dashed in and Hemlock appeared, drippingwet. “I want a messenger to go to Macdonell to tell him the Americansare on their way to him,” he shouted.“Confound them,” exclaimed Forsyth, “I’ll gang at ance.”“An’ leave us twa women bodies oor lane?” complained his wife, “No, no,you maun bide, an’ proteck us.”Hemlock was disconcerted. “Maggie,” he appealed, “won’t you go? Takethe canoe and you will be at the ford in a few minutes.”“Yes,” she responded, with quiet decision, “and what am I to say?”“Tell the Colonel that the Americans in strength are marching throughthe woods on this side of the river, intending to surprise him andcapture his position. Their advance will be on him in half an hour. Sayto him, to send over men to meet them and I will join with my band. Igo to watch them.” Without another word, he left and rushed back intothe forest.Maggie stepped lightly to where the canoe was moored, loosened therope, and paddled down the river with all the strength she had. Whenit struck the bank at Morrison’s she was glad to see so many astirand hastened to the door. “You, Maggie, at this early hour,” cried MrsMorrison, “naething wrang I hope?”“I must see the Colonel,” she said, catching for breath.“There he is,” said Mrs Morrison, pointing to an officer engaged inreading a letter by the fire.Maggie repeated Hemlock’s message. Macdonell listened with sparklingeyes, and when she had done said, “Thank you, my bonnie lass, you havedone the King a service, and when the Yankees come they will find usready to gie their lang nebs a smell o’ oor claymores.”Hastening out, he gave his orders in quick succession, and withsurprising alacrity for a volunteer force, the men fell in. Twocompanies were soon complete. “Now, Captain Bruyére, if your men do aswell as you will yourself all will be well; and for you, Captain Daly,I know by long experience what a loyal Irishman is. Hold your grounduntil I get up to you with the other companies.”The men quietly descended the bank and plunged into the river, whichtook them nearly to the middle, for owing to the recent rains it wasdeep. Gaining the opposite bank, they were swallowed up in the woods.Gazing over the tree-tops, which looked peaceful in the calm of a dull,moist, autumnal day, Maggie wondered what was going on beneath theircover--wished she could see the advancing Americans and the men whohad just gone to meet them. There was an interval of suspense. Then,suddenly, there was a sharp volley and the quiet air became filledwith shouts, and yells, and cries of frightened men. All at once thereburst from the bush on to the river bank, a good way up, a string ofhabitants, flying in terror, their blue tuques streaming behind them,and few of them having muskets, for they had thrown them away to aidtheir flight. “The cowardly loons,” muttered Macdonell, “it would servethem right to give them a taste of shot.” On reaching the ford, theytumultuously dashed in. As the foremost came up the bank the Coloneldemanded an explanation. They had been surprised by the unexpectedappearance of a great host of Americans and ran to save themselves.Attention, however, was now attracted from the fugitives by therecommencement of the firing, which was sharp and continuous, relievedby the yells and whoops of the Indians.“Hasten!” shouted Macdonell to the troops who were lining up, “do younot hear the firing? Our comrades need us.”The head of the column had reached the water’s edge, when there wasa burst of cheering. “That’s our lads,” said the Colonel, “they musthave won the day. Halt! We will not seek to share the credit of theirvictory.” In a few minutes a body of the Fencibles reappeared, withseveral prisoners and bearing a few wounded men. Their report was thatthey had encountered the advance guard of the American brigade, which,although elated at the rout of the outpost of habitants, fled at thefirst fire. The Colonel ordered the men to retire and wait behind thebreastworks that commanded the ford. “It is not likely,” he remarkedto his adjutant, “that the Americans will now attack us, seeing theirdesign to surprise us has miscarried.” Half an hour later, Hemlockarrived with his braves, at whose girdles hung several fresh scalps.He told Macdonell that the Americans had given up their intention ofgaining the ford and had gone into camp nearly two miles above, in agrove beside the river. Seeing how slight was the prospect of morefighting on that side of the river, he was going to join the main-body.On hearing this reassuring news, Maggie slipped away to her canoe andpaddled homewards.On coming in sight of the shanty she was amazed and alarmed by thechange that had taken place in her short absence. American soldierswere clustered around it, and a few horses picketed. Fearing theworst, she drew near. Seated by the fire were several officers warmingthemselves and drying their clothes, and with whom her mother was inaltercation.“Come to free us, say ye? What wad ye free us frae?”“From the tyranny of European monarchy,” answered an officer with asmile.“It maun be a licht yoke that we never felt. Mak us free, dootless,like that blackamoor servant that’s cooking yer breakfast.”“Waal, no,” said another officer, “yer a furriner, ye know, but yerwhite.”“A foreigner!” exclaimed Mrs Forsyth, “hae I lived to be ca’ed in myain house, a foreigner! I belang to nae sic trash. Manners maun bescarce whaur you come frae, my man.”“That’s all right, old woman; the old man will understand how it is. Wehave come to make you independent.”“Auld man! Auld woman! God forgie you for haein’ nae respeck for greyhairs. My guid man, sir, taks nae stock in ye or your fine words. Nichtand mornin’ does he pray for King George an’ that his throne may bepreserved. You’re a set o’ land-loupers, wha hae nae business here an’its my howp afore nicht you may be fleein’ back to whaur ye cam frae.”“Canada folk are not all like you.”“Ay, that they are. There’s no an’ Auld Country family from here to theBasin that winna gie you the back o’ their hand, an’ no ane that wadnasuner lose a’ than come unner yer rule.”Afraid that further controversy might result unpleasantly, Maggie lefther attitude of listening outside the door and entered. One or two ofthe younger officers rose and bowed; the others stared.“Oh, Maggie, I wish you had stayed where you were,” said her mother,“you have come into the lion’s den, for your father is no maister here.”“I am sure, mother, these gentlemen will not harm us.”“Not at all,” interrupted one of the strangers, “and in a few hours wewill leave you alone again.”“The sicht o’ your backs will be maist welcome,” remarked Mrs Forsyth.“Where is father?”“Helpin’ thae Yankees to get a haud o’ his ain property. They took himoot to get fodder for their horses.”There was a bustle outside and presently two soldiers carried in ayoung lad, in lieutenant’s uniform, whose white face told that he hadbeen wounded. They were about to lay him down in front of the fire,when Mrs Forsyth darted forward: “No, na; dinna pit the puir chiel onthe floor; tak him to my ain bed,” and she helped to place him there.Two surgeons took off his coat and shirt, when the wound appeared; abullet had gone through the fleshy part beneath the arm-pit, causingsome loss of blood without doing serious injury. When the surgeonssaid he would recover, Mrs Forsyth’s face beamed and she bustledabout to get the requisites needed to clean and dress the wound,while, under her orders, Maggie made gruel to revive his strength.While thus engaged, officers came and went, and the house was neverwithout several of them. There came a tall, square-built man, whoseshoulder-straps indicated high rank, and his quiet, resolute face oneaccustomed to command. He advanced to the bed where the wounded ladlay, asked a few questions, and spoke encouragingly to the sufferer.“It is too bad that Dingley, of all our corps, should have had thisluck,” remarked an officer.“Yes, and to no purpose. I fear the miscarriage of our plan to surprisethe ford will lead to the abandonment of the purpose to captureMontreal.”“There is not a man in the army that does not wish we were inwinter-quarters. To fight in such a country at this season is more thanflesh and blood can stand.”“Yet to go back will disgrace us,” said the superior officer, whowithdrew.“Who is that?” asked Maggie of one of the surgeons.“That is Col. Purdy, and if he had been in command we would not havespent all summer doing nothing and come here in the end of October.”“Yet he failed in capturing the ford,” remarked Maggie, with a sparklein her eye.“He could not help the weather and the dark night that kept us standingin the woods until daybreak. After all, we would have surprised theguard and taken the ford had it not been for somebody, perhaps atraitor among ourselves, who carried word of our coming.”“Maybe,” said Maggie demurely, “but you did not get the ford and whatcan you do now?”“Nothing, I am afraid. The failure of our brigade to carry the key ofthe enemy’s position may cause the General to give up the enterprise.”CHAPTER XIII.On leaving Morrison’s, Hemlock hurried to the front, followed byhis braves. As he reached each successive line of defence he pausedbriefly to scan it, but when he came to that which had been entrustedto the Indians, and which was within sight of the front, he halted tofraternize with his brethren and share their fare, for it was now noon.The urgent requests of the chiefs, that he should stay with them andaid in the threatened conflict, he declined, saying he wanted to bewith the first line, and his dusky comrades afterwards recalled thathe parted with more than usual ceremony and that when he and his smallband gained the eminence on the other side of the ravine, he lookedback and waved his hand in farewell. A tramp of a few minutes broughthim to the advance line, where he found men still busy felling androlling trees to strengthen the abattis. Inquiring for the officer incommand he came upon him, a short, broad-shouldered man, engaged inswearing at one of his men for neglect of duty. On seeing the Indianshe turned, and with hearty gesture grasped Hemlock’s extended hand.“Ha, bon camarado, have you come to help?”“Will there be a fight?” asked Hemlock.“Yes, yes; stand on this stump and you can see for yourself.”With cautious movement Hemlock scanned the scene. In front of theabattis there was a narrow clearing that skirted the river bank as faras the view extended. On the road and adjoining fields were masses ofAmerican troops, with the smoke rising from the fires at which theywere cooking dinner. “You see, Hemlock,” said Colonel deSalaberry,“they may make an attack any minute. Those mounted officers looking atus from the road are the General and his staff.”Hemlock gave a grunt of satisfaction. “Where will we stand?” he asked.“Get into the woods and cover our flank,” deSalaberry replied. Withoutanother word, Hemlock motioned to his men and led the way to wherethe line of defence ended in the bush. Here he spread out his men andawaited the onset. Half an hour passed when the roll of drums washeard, and Hemlock saw a brigade falling into rank on the road. Whenall were in place, the column moved slowly, for the road was a canal ofmud intersected by pools of water. As they approached within range theorder to deploy was shouted, and the men streamed on to the clearinguntil a line the length of the field was formed. Then they faced round,and Hemlock heard the command to advance, when the Americans came on, asolid wall of humanity, moving with slow and steady step. Instantly,the bushy abattis, behind which the British lay, silent as the graveuntil now, became alive with the puffs of musket-shots and the shoutsof those who fired them. On the Americans came with even step untilwell within blank range, when they were halted and the order givento fire by platoons. The regular roll of musketry that ensued spokewell for their nerve and discipline. The shower of bullets they sentstreaming into the bush in front of them had no effect in checkingthe opposing fire, which was irregular but lively. It soon becameapparent that firing by platoons was a waste of ammunition, a mereflinging of bullets into the tree-tops, and there was a movement in thecompanies in the column next the woods, which were swung forward, inorder that they might gain a position which would enable them to poura cross-fire into the British position. The men moved steadily, allthe while pouring in volleys, that caused the defenders of the upperend of the British line to leave and go lower down. It was a criticalmoment. The British line was in danger of being flanked, and Hemlocksaw its peril. He with his band were concealed in the woods that edgedthe clearing, and so far had not fired a shot, for Hemlock, who knewthe futility of irregular troops engaging in a musketry duel with adisciplined force, had determined not to show where they were until theAmericans came to close quarters. Now he saw his opportunity. Signingto his men to follow, he stealthily crept until he was close behindthe American companies that were edging to flank the British line.When near upon the unsuspecting Americans, he sprang to his feet, gavethe war-whoop, and fired his musket, his followers doing likewise. TheAmericans looked round in terrified astonishment, and saw the Indiansleaping towards them with ear-piercing yells and brandishing theirtomahawks. They wavered, broke rank, and fled towards their supports,who were a short distance behind. Hemlock bounded among the fleeing menand two had fallen under his hand, when a volley of bullets from thesupporting column came shrieking through the air. All save one passedharmlessly over the heads of the red-men--that one struck Hemlock inthe breast, and he sank upon his right knee. Alarmed at his fall, hismen desisted from following the fleeing enemy, and seizing hold of himhurried into the shelter of the woods. They laid him down and wereabout to loosen his jacket, for he was in a faint, when there rose aburst of cheering from the British line, on seeing the success of theIndians’ diversion. The sound caught the ear of the dying chief. Hiseyes opened as from slumber, rolled wildly for a moment, and his breastheaved convulsively. He staggered to his feet, and lifting aloft histomahawk, dripping with the blood of its last victim, he raised thewar-whoop, suddenly stopped short, rolled unsteadily, and then fellas a pine-tree falls. An Indian knelt down beside him and raised hishead while he pressed his hand on his forehead. There was no responsivethrob. Hemlock was dead.       *       *       *       *       *“I would swear that was Hemlock’s whoop,” said Morton to himself. Hestood amid a group of cavalrymen who were watching intently what wasgoing on from a field within easy view. He had followed the engagementwith intelligent interest; had noted how the American infantry hadadvanced, deployed, formed line, and opened fire on the Britishposition. What followed provoked him. When he saw how ineffectualthe British fire was upon the American ranks, though standing inthe open and within easy range, he ground his teeth in vexation.“Those militiamen could not hit a barn; a hundred regulars would havedecimated the American column with half the ammunition that has beenspent,” he muttered to himself. When the upper end of the Americanline swung forward, his thoughts changed. “Ah, they are going to fixbayonets and carry our position by assault. God help our lads.” Hewas mistaken; the movement was to gain a point whence to rake theBritish position with an enfilading fire. As he saw the Americans moveforward unopposed and the British fire slacken from the bush opposite,his heart sank. “The day is lost: in five minutes the Americans willhave possession of the far end of that bushy entrenchment, and itwill be untenable.” Suddenly the war-whoop of the Indians was heard,then came their wild assault, and the flight of the Americans. “Welldone, Hemlock!” exulted Morton, “no other lungs than yours could haveraised that shriek and your timely move has certainly checked theattempt to flank the British position. What next?” Having ascertainedso unpleasantly that the wood to their left was held by Indians, theAmericans did not try again to turn the British position, and thecompanies that had broken in disorder were reformed and placed inrear, while the battalions in line continued to pour volleys into thebush heaps in front of them. Hampton and his staff were on horseback,watching the progress of the contest from a bit of rising ground bythe river. At this juncture Morton observed him signal with his handto some one on the other side of the river, and from that quarter,soon after, came the rattle of musketry. It did not last long and whenit died away, an orderly was detached from the General’s staff andcame galloping to deliver a message to Izard, who instantly gave theorder to cease firing. The column fell back a few paces and the menstood in rank, awaiting orders. To Morton’s surprise, firing from theBritish line also ceased, and the two combatants simply looked at oneanother. “Can it be,” asked Morton, “that our General does not wantto provoke an engagement and would be content to see the Americansleave?” The brief October day was drawing to an end, and still theAmerican brigade stood immovable and there was not a sign of lifealong the British line. When the grey clouds began to be tinged by thesetting sun, and it was apparent nothing more could be done that day,Izard received the order to fall back. As if on parade, the evolutionsrequisite were gone through and the column began its march to the camp,three miles in rear.“Hillo, Morton, you seem stupefied. Lost in amaze at the gallantry ofyour comrades-in-arms permitting a brigade to file off under their nosewithout an attempt to molest them. Eh?” The voice was that of ColonelVanderberg.“I confess you interpret my thoughts,” answered Morton. “I am glad tosee you back.”“I have had a fatiguing day’s duty and am not yet done. I have justleft the General, who instructed me to go over and see Purdy andarrange for the withdrawal of his force. Will you come with me?”“That I will; I am tired of standing here.”As they approached the river, Morton noted that the bank was stronglypicketted by infantry and that a body of cavalry were bivouaced in afield beside the road. Stepping upon a raft that had been extemporizedto form a ferry with the other side, the Colonel and Morton were landedin the midst of Purdy’s men, who were making themselves as comfortableas possible before their campfires. They looked tired and dejected.The Colonel was told Purdy had gone to remain until morning with hisoutposts, as a night attack upon them was looked for. Accompanied bya soldier to show them the way they went on, now floundering thru’marshy spots and again jumping little creeks, alternating with bitsof dry bank and scrubby brush, until they emerged into a clearing.Morton caught his breath with astonishment. In front was the shantyof the Forsyths! He had had no idea it was so near. The door wasopen and he could see it was full of officers. Around the house wereresting a strong body of troops. Col. Vanderberg pushed in and wassoon in earnest conversation with Purdy, who sat smoking by the fire.Morton remained at the door and scanned the interior, which was filledby a cloud of tobacco-smoke and reeked with the odor of cooking andof steaming wet clothes. In the corner, where the bed stood, he sawMaggie leaning over a recumbent youth, whose white face and bandagedshoulder told of a wound. Morton’s heart jumped at sight of her andhis lips twitched. The next moment, as he saw how gently she soothedthe sufferer, a pang of jealousy succeeded, and he clenched his teeth.Pulling his cloak more tightly around him he entered and drew up behindColonel Vanderberg, who was saying, “Then I am to tell the General fromyou, that you will not join him tonight.”“Yes, tell him I cannot; that the river is too deep to ford and toowide to bridge and that it is out of the question to cross 1500 men onrafts. At daylight we will march back the way we came and join him atSpears.”“It will be an unwelcome message, for he counted on your rejoining himtonight.”“I care not,” bluffly retorted Purdy, “I am a soldier and know asoldier’s duty and have to think of those under me. I’ll risk no livesto humor his whims.”“He fears a night assault upon your brigade.”“So do I,” replied Purdy, blowing a cloud of tobacco smoke, “and wouldfear it more if assailed while on the march through these woods or inthe endeavor to cross the river. The General should have ordered us toretire while there was daylight.”“Ah, well, I have delivered my message and must go back with my answer.Come, Morton.”At the sound of the familiar name Maggie looked round, and when hereyes fell on Morton, she blushed deeply. To hide her confusion fromthe roomful of men, she turned her back and bowed her head close tothe pillow whereon lay the head of the patient. More nettled thanever, Morton started to move quickly away, when there appeared at thedoorway the frail form of Mrs Forsyth. “God be gude to us, if this isno Morton. Oh but I’m gled to see you and sae will the gudeman. I wentout to look for him, an’ hav’na found him, but he’ll sune be here an’,onyway, you’re going to bide wi’ us.”“I am sorry that I cannot.”“But ye maun. Ye dinna ken hoo yer takin’ awa’ concerned us and pit usaboot.”“You forget I am a prisoner.”“Prisoner! You are nae prisoner. You’re noo in oor hoose an’ you’lljust bide here an’ let thae Yankees gae awa.”“I am afraid they would insist on taking me with them.”“Hoots, man, I’ll haud ye. Maggie, do you ken Morton’s come?”“Yes, mother; I saw him.”“Weel, come ower and mak him stay an’ no gang back to be bullyragged bya wheen Yankees.”Maggie made no reply, but turned to avoid the gaze of the Americansattracted by the scene at the door and her mother’s words. Morton alsofelt mortified at the situation. “Thank you, Mrs Forsyth, but I mustgo, and tell your husband and sons I have never forgot them and neverwill.” Eluding her grasp he followed Colonel Vanderberg, who stoodoutside the door with laughing countenance. He had not gone far when aswift step was heard behind and his name was uttered. Turning he sawMaggie, who held out her right hand. “Take this,” she said, “I maynot see you--again.” There was a sob as she uttered the last word. Hegrasped what she held to him and before he could say a word she hadturned and fled back to the house. Morton held the object up to thelight of the nearest camp-fire. It was his signet-ring.More perplexed than ever, angry with Maggie and angry with himself,he braced himself and followed the Colonel in silence until the campwas reached. Supper awaited them, and that disposed of, the Colonel,wearied with his day’s exertion, flung himself on the ground and fellasleep. Morton tried in vain to do likewise.At daybreak the army was astir and the expectation of the men wasan order to renew the assault upon the British position. No suchorder came, and it was wearing well into the forenoon when thecommanding-officers were summoned to attend at the General’s tent tohold a council-of-war. Among others Colonel Vanderberg went. Mortonwatched eagerly his return, and when he came his questioning eyes toldwhat his tongue, from courtesy, would not ask. “Well, Morton, you wouldlike to know what has been decided upon, and as it is no secret, I willtell you. The campaign has been abandoned and the army goes back to theStates to go into winter-quarters. We marched into Canada to co-operatewith Wilkinson. Last night the General received a despatch that he hadnot yet left Sackett’s Harbor, while we supposed he was now steeringhis triumphant way down the St Lawrence, and might even be at the mouthof the Chateaugay waiting for us. It was argued that, as Wilkinson hadnot moved, and it was uncertain if he would, nothing was to be gainedby our army going on, for, without the flotilla, we could not crossthe St Lawrence to take Montreal.”“And what of the disgrace of retiring before an enemy whom you haveburnt powder with for an afternoon?”“There you have us, Morton. I urged that, before we fell back, thehonor of our flag required our routing the enemy in front of us, butthe General showed that he has had all along complete information ofits position and strength, obtained from spies and deserters--thatthere are six lines of wooden breastworks, held by Indians and lighttroops, and that only after storming them would we come in face ofthe main position, where the regulars are entrenched with cannon andcommanded by Sir George Prevost in person. When there was nothing tobe gained, it was asked, what was the use of further fighting? Themiscarriage of the attempt under Purdy to flank the enemy’s positiondiscouraged our officers, who, altho’ they do not say it, want to getaway from this miserable condition of cold and wet and mud.”“So we go back whence we came?” remarked Morton moodily, as he thoughtof the stable at Chateaugay.“My dear fellow, bear up; I will do my best to have you exchanged.”Morton shook his head as he said, “I am not held as a prisoner of war.”The Colonel bit his lip. “I have not told you all. The carrying of thedecision of the council to Wilkinson was entrusted to me.”“And so you leave me!” exclaimed Morton sadly.“I start after dinner, and cheer up, man; we will have a good one as afarewell feast.” Then, with evident hesitation, the Colonel went on,as delicately as possible, to show Morton that he had better withdrawhis parole and go again under a guard. Removed from his protection, itwould not be safe to move among men soured by an unfortunate campaign.Morton assented and expressed his thanks for advice he knew it painedthe Colonel to give. Dinner over, the Colonel’s horse was brought, andwith a warm grasp of the hand he bade Morton good-bye, leapt into thesaddle, and galloped out of sight. Morton saw him not again.In a despondent mood Morton turned away and sought the guard-tent,when he gave himself up to the officer-of-the-day, who accepted hissurrender as a matter of course. The soldiers took little notice ofhim, being in high spirits at the prospect of going back to the Statesand busily engaged in the preparations to leave. That afternoon partof the baggage-train left and went floundering along the muddy roadto Four Corners. As evening drew nigh, the rain, accompanied by a raweast wind, recommenced, flooding the level clearances upon which thetents were pitched and making everybody miserable. The captain of theguard sought shelter from the blast and the water by causing the tentshe controlled to be pitched on the slope of a hollow scooped out by acreek, and in one of them Morton lay down along with seven soldiers.Sleep soon came to relieve him of his depression in mind and discomfortof body, and the hours sped while he was so unconscious that he didnot hear when his companions left to take their turn on duty and thosethey relieved took their places in the tent. His first deep sleep wasover when he felt that some furtive hand was being passed over thecanvas to find the opening. When the flap was drawn aside, so dark wasit that he could not distinguish who stood there. He supposed it wassome belated private seeking cover from the pelting rain and he wasabout to turn and resume his slumber when a flint was struck and thetent was lit for a moment by its sparks. Somebody lighting a pipe, hesaid, too drowsy to look. A minute afterwards he felt that the curtainof the tent where his head lay was being cautiously lifted and soon ahand reached in, touched his face, and then catching the collar of hiscoat began pulling. He made a motion to resist, when a voice whispered,“Hemlock.” In a flash he realized he was about to be rescued, and,guided by the hand that grasped him, slowly crept out. No sooner was heupon his feet, than he felt men were gliding past him into the tent.All at once there was a sound of striking, as of knives being driveninto the bodies of the sleeping inmates, a slight commotion, a fewgroans, and then all was still. Morton’s flesh crept, as he guessedat the horrid work in which the Indians were engaged. So intenselydark was it, that he could see nothing. There was a slight shufflingof feet and he was grasped by the arm on either side and hurriedforward. He knew they were following the course of the ravine, for hecould hear the wash of the creek. Suddenly his conductors came to ahalt and there was a pause, until a faint chirrup was heard. Then thebank was climbed and, emerging on a clearance, Morton saw the tents ofthe American camp some distance to his left, lit up by the smolderingfires that burned dimly between the rows. Looking round, he for thefirst time saw his companions, who were, as he suspected, a band ofIndians. Taking advantage of every available cover the Indians glided,in single file, across the bit of open that intervened between wherethey stood and the bush. When its shelter was gained, they halted ona dry knoll, and squatted, when they began to giggle and to chatterin their native tongue, plainly exulting over the success of theirraid. Morton tried to communicate with them, but found they could notspeak English, and the only word they uttered which he recognized was“Hemlock,” altho’ that great chief was not among them. One of themcould speak a little French, which, however, Morton did not understand.When daylight began to creep in upon the darkness, they became alert,and as soon as it was clear enough to see where they were going theystarted; Morton had no idea in what direction. All he knew was, thattheir course led them over a swampy country intersected by stonyridges, and that had it not been that the leaders of the file broke apath he could never have followed. The exertion was exhausting and hewould have succumbed at the end of the first hour had it not been thatthe spirit of freedom elated him, and the knowledge that every milehe overtook increased the distance between him and the hated bondagefrom which he had escaped spurred him on. On the edge of an apparentlylimitless swamp they paused before entering upon it to have a smoke.It was apparent that they carried no food. Morton sank upon a pile ofleaves that had drifted against a log and stretched his wearied legs.Refreshed by the rest, he faced the swamp with courage, soon finding,however, that, without the help of the Indians, he could have madelittle headway. With the light step and agility of cats they steppedover quaking surfaces and sprang from log to log until solid land wasreached, and with it came the sound of rushing water. Escaping from thebrush, a broad river, dashing impetuously over a rocky channel, burstin view. Following its bank in single file, Morton saw it grew wider,until it expanded into a lake, when he knew it was the St Lawrence.On coming opposite the promontory that marked the inlet of the riverfrom the lake, the Indians eagerly scrutinized it. Gathering some dampleaves they made a smoke. The signal was seen by those opposite, fora long-boat was launched from under the trees and rapidly approachedthem. Morton’s heart leapt with joy when he distinguished that thesteersman had a red-coat on, and as the boat drew nearer and hecould make out the ruddy countenances of the crew, frank and open inexpression, and catch the sound of their hearty English speech, hecould not resist the impulse to swing his hat and wake the echoes witha lusty cheer. The Indians grinned and one clapped him on the back inhigh approval.The corporal in charge of the boat informed Morton that he belonged tothe garrison of Coteau-du-lac and was, for the week, with the partyon the point, to guard the south channel. There were so many Indiansthat the boat had to leave part for a second trip. On landing at thepoint Morton was warmly welcomed by the officer in charge, and giventhe best he had, which proved to be fried pork and biscuit. At noonthe boat that daily brought supplies from Coteau arrived, and in itMorton with the Indians embarked. As soon as he stepped ashore, hemade for the commander’s quarters and was shown into the presence ofCol. Lethbridge. On announcing who he was, the Colonel welcomed himas one from the dead and impatiently demanded to hear when and how hehad escaped. When he came to tell of the exploit of the precedingnight, and that the Indians who had performed in it were waiting inthe barrack-yard, the Colonel thumped the table and swore each man ofthem would take home all the tobacco and pork he could carry. Going outto see them before they left, Morton learned through an interpreterof Hemlock’s death and that his rescue was in fulfilment of an orderhe had left. They were going to Oka to join the party who were on theway from the Chateaugay with his body, to bury it beside that of hisdaughter, and hold a funeral lodge. Morton was deeply moved. “Faithfulsoul,” he exclaimed, “would to heaven he had lived that I might haveshown him my gratitude.” Applying to the paymaster he obtained anadvance, and in parting with the Indians pressed a big Mexican dollarinto the hand of each of them.Colonel Lethbridge insisted on Morton’s being his guest, and afterleaving him in his bedroom sent his servant to wait upon him, and whobrought a fresh suit of clothes. Morton was the hero of the garrison,and when he appeared at the mess-table, so many complimentary speecheswere made, so many songs sung, and so many toasts drank that it wasnigh midnight when he got to bed. He rose next morning intent onentering harness again, and over a late breakfast discussed with Col.Lethbridge as to how he could rejoin his regiment, which had beencalled to the Niagara frontier, and it was agreed he should go by thenext convoy, always provided Wilkinson did not come, which, after whatMorton reported of Hampton’s army returning to the States, Lethbridgedoubted. Each day tidings of Wilkinson’s leaving the shelter ofSackett’s Harbor had been looked for, and the feeling was that unlesshe left within a week he would not come at all, for the season was nowwell-advanced, and already on several mornings had ice formed roundboats while lying at Coteau. Col. Scott had been sent to Cornwallto superintend the preparations there, and Lethbridge had taken hisplace at the less important point. The following week the unexpectedhappened--late one afternoon a gunboat came down the lake under pressof canvas, with word that Wilkinson had started--was descending theriver with a flotilla of 300 boats bearing 7000 men. A few days ofexcitement and wearing suspense succeeded, and then, came word of thebattle of Crystler’s Farm--how a strong brigade of Americans had landedat the head of the Long Sault rapids to clear the north bank of thebatteries the British had planted to prevent the flotilla descendingand been routed by General Boyd. Treading upon the heels of the newsof that decisive victory came the announcement that Wilkinson hadabandoned his undertaking and had gone back to the United States bysailing into Salmon river with his beaten army. The campaign was endedfor the season, and troops were ordered into winter-quarters. The daythe news reached Coteau of Wilkinson’s flight to French Mills, a stringof boats came up loaded with military stores for Upper Canada and a fewtroops. To Morton’s astonishment, among them was the detachment he hadconducted to the Chateaugay. The camp there having been broken up, theywere on their way to join the regiment, and hoped to reach it beforenavigation closed. Gladly Morton resumed command and six days laterreported at Niagara.CHAPTER XIV.After a night of excitement from wild alarms, the Americans left theForsyth household at daylight, leaving not one behind, for even thewounded officer they carried with them in a litter. Utterly worn outthe family sought rest, and it was late in the day when the fatherarose, and leaving the others, sleeping, went out to see what of hisproperty had been left. The more closely he examined the more fullythe unwelcome fact was forced upon him, that he was left destitute,and when he came upon the black head of his cow, which the soldiershad slaughtered for beef, he sat down in a despairing mood. “It’s nofor mysel’ I’m troubled,” he exclaimed, “but for my ailin’ wife andpuir Maggie! To face a Canadian winter wi’ a bare loof is awfu.” Andhe gave way to a fit of despondency. “This winna do,” he said with arueful look at the devastation around him, “a stout heart to a steybrae, and wi’ God’s help, I’ll mak the best o’t.” When Maggie sometimeafterwards appeared at the door he was industriously laboring to bringhis surroundings into order. “Weel, lass, an’ hoo are ye after oor bigpairty?”“No so ill; but, father, what are we to do, there’s no a bite in thehouse? The cellar is rookit as clean as if a pack of wolves had visitedit.”The old man approached and taking his daughter by the hand drew her tothe seat by the door-step. “Maggie, I ken ye hae a brave spirit and canbear the worst. I am a ruined man. The Yankees have eaten us oot o’house an’ hold. The very boards o’ the byre hae been torn awa’ to lichttheir fires. Oor coo, the young beasts, the pigs, hae a’ been eaten.There’s no even a chuckie left.”“O but there is,” interrupted Maggie, “see to Jenny Tapknot overthere,” pointing smilingly thro’ tears to a favorite chicken that hadeluded the soldiers and was eyeing them from a branch.“Weel, weel, we hae one leevin’ thing left us. O’ a’ oor crop thereis naething to the fore but the unthreshed wheat, an’ mickle o’t isuseless from the sojers using it to lie on.”“Was it right, father, for them to take your property without payingyou?”“Pay me! The thocht o’ paying a subject o’ the King never entered theirheids. Micht is richt wi’ them. What we are to do is no just clear tome yet, but we’ll trust in Him wha has never failed to supply oor bitean’ sup. Only, Maggie, ye maun for yer mither’s sake put a cheerfu’face on’t an’ mak the best o’t.”“Hoot, father, what gars ye doot me? We hae aye been provided for an’sae will we yet, says the auld sang. You take the canoe an’ go down toMorrison’s an’ see what you can get there to keep us going until themorn, an’ while you’re away I’ll red the house an’ hae a’ ready forsupper gin mither wakens.”With brightened face and hopeful step the old man did as asked anddid not return empty-handed. Over the frugal meal the situation wasdiscussed and both the husband and daughter were glad to see that thecalamity that had overtaken them so far from overwhelming Mrs Forsyth,roused her, and revived the active and hopeful spirit that had been afeature in her character before ailments and age had overtaken her.Long and earnest was the consultation by the fireside that night, andmany a plan proposed to tide over the long months that must intervenebefore another harvest could be reaped. As bed-time drew near, thefather lifted down the book, and after they had sung the 23rd psalm,he read the 17th chapter of First Kings, and poured out his heart inthanksgiving for the unnumbered blessings bestowed upon him and his,and, above all, for the departure of the invader.Two days afterwards, when it had become assured that Hampton was inleisurely retreat whence he came, those of the militia, at Baker’scamp, who wished were given leave to go to their homes, and the Forsythlads returned. They were much exasperated at the plundered stateof their home, and more provoked than before at the policy whichpermitted the enemy to journey back over 24 miles of Canadian territorywithout attempt to harass him. Leaving the scanty pay they had receivedas soldiers, it was arranged they should go lumbering for the winter,their wages to be sent home as they got them. The winter proved a hardone. The presence of so large a body of troops had consumed much ofthe produce the settlers needed for themselves, and although they hadbeen paid what they considered at the time good prices they now foundit difficult to procure what they wanted from Montreal. The result tothe Forsyths was, that their neighbors were unable to give them muchhelp and had it not been that the miller at the Basin gave credit, theywould have been sometimes in actual want. Despite the bareness of thecupboard, the winter was a happy one: the very effort to endure andmake the best of their hard lot conducing to cheerfulness. When thesnow began to melt, the sons returned, and the new clearing at whichthe father had worked all winter was made ready for seed, so that moreland than before was put under a crop. The pinch was worst in July anduntil the potatoes were fit to eat. After that there was rude plentyand an abundant harvest was reaped.With returning comfort Mrs Forsyth began to fail. Whether it was theeffects of the lack of usual food, or the strain to help the familyhaving been beyond her strength, signified little. With the coming ofthe snow she began to lose strength and, as her husband saw with deepsorrow, “to dwine awa.” She accepted her lot uncomplainingly, studyinghow to give least trouble, and spending her days between her bed andthe easy chair by the fireside, generally knitting, for she said shehoped to leave them a pair of stockings apiece. The New Year had passedand the days were lengthening when it was plain her rest was near.It was a beautiful day when she asked that her chair be moved so thatshe could see out at the window. The brilliant sunlight fell on thesnow that shrouded the winding course of the Chateaugay and flecked thetrees, while a blue haze hung in the distance that prophesied of comingspring. “A bonnie day,” she remarked.“Ay,” replied Maggie, “warm enough to be a sugar day.”“It’s ower fine to last and there will be storms and hard frost aforethe trees can be tapped,” said Mrs Forsyth, “an’ I’ll no be here tohelp.”“Dinna say that, mither; the spring weather will bring you round.”“Na, na, my bairn. The robin’s lilt will no wauken me, nor will my eenagain see the swelling bud, but through the mercy o’ my God I trustthey will be lookin’ on the everlasting spring o’ the bidin’ place o’his people.”“Oh, mither: I canna bear the thocht o’ parting wi’ you.”“It’s natural to feel sae; my ain heart-strings were wrung when mymither deed, an’ yet I see noo it was for the best. I have become acumberer o’ the grund, unable to labor even for an hour a day in thevineyard, and sae the Maister o’t is goin’ to gie me the rest o’ which,lang since, I got frae His hand the arles. Ae thing ye maun promise me,Maggie, and that is ye maun never leev your faither.”“What makes you think sae o’ me, mother? I hav’na even a thocht o’leevin’ him.”“I ken ye hav’na a thocht the noo o’ sic a thing, but the day will comewhen you micht--when your love for anither would incline you to forgetyour duty. Sweet the drawing o’ heart to heart in the spring o’ youth,an’ the upspringing, when you least expec’ it, o’ the flow’r o’ love.The peety is, sae mony are content with the flow’r an’ pu’ it an’ letthe stem wither. Your faither an’ I werna o’ that mind. The flow’r grewinto a bauld stalk in the simmer o’ affection, an’ noo we reap theharvest. It’s no like Scotch folk to open their mous on sic maitters,but I may tell you, my lassie, that sweet an’ warm as was oor love whenyour faither cam a coortin’, it’s nae mair to be compared to oor lovesince syne an’ to this minute, than the licht o’ lightnin’ is to thesunshine. I thocht to hae tended him in his last days, to hae closedhis een, an’ placed the last kiss on his cauld lips, but it’s no to be,an’ ye maun promise me to perform what your mither wad hae dune had shelived.”“I promise, mother; I promise never to leave him.”“Weel does he deserve a’ you can dae for him; he’s puir, he’s hamely inlooks, he’s no sae quick in thocht or speech as mony; but he is whatmony great an’ rich an’ smairt men are not--an honest man, wha strivesin a quiet way to do his duty by his fellowman an’ his Maker.”“What makes you speak so, mother? I am sure I never gave you cause tothink I’d leave the family.”“Your brothers will gang their ain gate by-and-by an’ their wives michtna want to hae the auld man at their ingle; only o’ you may I ask thatwhither you go he shall go an’ drink o’ your cup an’ eat o’ your bread.Dinna marry ony man unless sure he will be kind to your faither an’ letyou do a dochter’s duty by him.”“I hav’na met ony man, mother, that will hae me, except auld Milne.”“Dinna mak fun o’ me, Maggie; you ken what I mean. The lad Morton willcome some day--.”“Wheesht, mother: he’s nothing to me.”“I ken different: you loe him deep an’ true an’ he loes you. Whether hewill pit pride o’ family an’ station aside to ask you to be his wifesome wad doot, but I div’na. He’ll be back, an’ when he does dinnaforget what I have said.”The heavy step of the father was here heard outside; the door openedand he came in. Drawing a chair beside his wife he sat down, and,without uttering a word, surveyed her wasted and furrowed face withtender gaze. She returned his affectionate look and placed her handin his. As she looked at them, sitting in the afternoon sunshine withclasped hands, and that radiant expression of mutual love, Maggie’sheart, already full, was like to burst. She hastened out and fallingbeneath a tree wept bitterly.       *       *       *       *       *Next morning when they awoke the sad truth became apparent, that themother of the family had had a change for the worse in her sleep. Hermind wandered and her strength had completely left. The only one sherecognized was her husband, and when he spoke she smiled. The spellsof unconsciousness grew longer as the day wore on and towards eveningit could be seen her last was near. As often happens in the Canadianwinter, a pet day had been followed by a storm. A piercing blast fromthe west filled the air with drift and sent the frozen snow rattlingon the window-panes. They were all gathered round her bed, when shewoke, and her eyes wonderingly looked upon them, tried to make out whatit all meant, and gave it up as hopeless. “Eh, sirs, a bonnie day,”she said, as if speaking to herself, “the westlin win’ blaws saft fraethe sea an’ the bit lammies rin after their mithers on the hill-side.Sune the kye will be comin’ hame an’ after milkin’ I’ll snod mysel’,for somebody’s comin’ to see somebody, an’ we’ll daunner doun e’e thegloamin’ by the burn. Isna he a comely lad! Stracht an’ supple, andan e’e in his heid that a bairn wad trust. Tak him? I’d gang tae thewarl’s end wi’ him.... What’s that! The kirk bell. I didna think it wassae late. Sure eneuch, there’s the folk strachlin’ ower the muir an’the laird riding on his powny.... Surely it’s growin’ mirk. Mither,tak me in your airms an’ pit me to sleep. What will you sing to me?The Flowers o’ the Forest, the nicht, mither. Kiss me noo, I’ll be abetter bairn the morn an’ dae what you tell me.... Na, na, pick yer ainflowers: this poesy is for my baby brither.... Faither, dinna lift yourhaun’ to me: I’m sorry. I’ll no dae it again. Whaur am I?... Faither,dinna you hear me? Oh come quick an’ save me, the tide is lowpin’ fastower the rock. There’s the boatie rowin’ to us: it’ll be here enow an’we’ll be saved.... Did you hear that? It’s Sandy the piper come tothe toun. Let’s rin an’ meet him.... I’m tired o’ daffin’ an wad haea rest. Let’s creep into the kirk-yaird an’ sit doun by granfaither’sgrave. Hoo sweet the merle sings, an’ tak tent to the corn-craik oweryonner.... Weel, weel, I canna understan’ it. His ways are no oor ways,but I’ll lippen to Him tae the end. Maggie, Maggie, whaur are ye? I’mgaun awa’, an’ I want you to rin an’ tell the goodman o’ the hoose tohae a chamber ready for me. What am I saying? God forgie me, my mindwanders; he’s had ane waitin’ for me this mony a day.... I see younoo, my bairns. Guid nicht, tae we meet again.”There was a long silence. The father rose, and closed the droopingeyelids that would never be lifted and laid down the weary head whichwould never move again.CHAPTER XV.One July morning Mr Forsyth was working in the field beside the riverwhen he saw a canoe shoot in sight. It drew up to the bank and itsoccupant walked towards him.“Man, it is you!” he exclaimed, grasping the extended hand. “At thefirst look I didna ken you. Hoo ye hae changed since last I saw you.”“I know I have,” answered Morton, “the months since we parted haveaged me more than half as many years would in ordinary course oflife. The hardships of war, the strife between life and death on thebattle-field, develop fast what is good or bad in a man.”“Ye’ll hae had your share o’ the fechtin?”“Yes; our regiment took part in all the movements in the Niagaradistrict, and during the campaigning season there was not a week we didnot exchange shots with the enemy or have to endure a toilsome march tocheck his plans.”“And were you hurt at a’?”“Nothing to speak of; scratches that did not keep me off duty over afew days. I may be thankful to have got off so well, for many a prettyfellow will never see home again.”“War’s a gruesome trade.”“It is that: I have seen scenes of horror that I try to banish from mymemory. The carnage at Lundy’s Lane was sickening, and the cries of thewounded for help heart-breaking, for, from the darkness and the enemy’spressing us, we could not reach them.”“That brither should butcher brither is awfu’ proof o’ total depravity.After a’, thae Yankees, though their ways are not oor ways, are flesho’ oor flesh, an’ we should live aside are anither in peace.”“In this war, at least, Mr Forsyth, they are to blame. They declaredit and if ever war is justifiable it is surely one like that we havefought and won, where a people rise to defend their native land againstthe invader.”“I dinna dispute you, but as I creep near to my end, my heart softensto my fellow-men o’ a’ creeds and races and I wish to see peace andgood-fellowship the warld ower.”“So do I, but sure and permanent peace is not to be won by surrender ofright. It is better for all that the best blood of Canada and Britainhas soaked the fields within the sound of the roar of Niagara, thanthat Canada should have become a conquered addition to the UnitedStates.”“You’re richt in that: the sacrifice is sair, but trial bitter, but acountry’s independence maun be maintained. Canadians will think mair o’their country when they see what it has cost to defend it. Noo that thewar is ended, you’ll be leaving Canada?”“That depends on what your daughter says. My regiment sails from Quebecby the end of the month.”“What mean ye, sir, by Maggie hae’in’ aucht to dae wi’ your going?”“Simply this, that if she will take me as her husband and you will giveyour consent, I shall sell my commission and remain in Canada.”“You are surely no in earnest? What has the dochter o’ a backwoodsfarmer t’ dae wi’ an officer?”“Since I landed in Canada I have had many false notions rudely tornaway, and one of them is, that there is any connection between worthand station in life. I have found more to admire in the shanty than Iever did in the parlors of the Old Country.”“That’s repeatin’ what Rabbie Burns wrote, the rank is but the guineastamp.”“I have proved it true: for the first time in my life I have becomeintimate with those whose living depends upon the labor of their hands,and my Old World notions have melted away, when I found them betterthan those whose boast it is they never soiled their fingers withmanual toil.”“Aye, aye; nae guid comes o’ tryin’ to escape the first command tofallen man, ‘in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.’”“What say you?” asked Morton.“To your asking Maggie? Oh, dinna speak o’t. She’s my ae ewe lamb and Icanna pairt wi’ her.”“I do not mean you should; we would go to Upper Canada together.”The old man paused and leant upon his hoe and Morton stood respectfullybehind him. After long silence he raised his head. “I canna answer you.It’s no for me to put my ain selfish will against her good; gang andlet her choose for hersel’.”“Thank you,” said Morton with emotion.“We have had a backward spring; frost every week a maist to the middleo’ June, an’ sic cauld winds since syne that naething grows. We haesown in hope, but I’m fearfu’ there will be little to reap. Sic aspring the auldest settler canna mind o’. Look at thae tatties! Whatpoor spindly things they are, an’ this the first week o’ July.”“It has not been so bad in the west.”“I’m glad to hear it. Weel, this being the first real warm day we’vehad, I tell’t Maggie to busk hersel’ and gang and veesit the neebors,for she’s been in a sad and sorrowfu’ way since her mither deed. Shesaid she had nae heart to veesit, but wad tak a walk alang the riverand be back to mak my denner. Her brithers we expect hame every dayfrom takin’ rafts to Montreal.”“I’ll go and seek her,” remarked Morton, as he turned, and the old manwent on hoeing. Morton had gone about a mile, when his eye caught theflutter of the linen kerchief Maggie had pinned round her neck. She didnot see him and as she sauntered before him, he marked her gracefulcarriage, and muttered to himself, “A woman worthy to woo and win.”Unwilling to startle her by going too near, he cried “Miss Forsyth.”She paused, turned in astonishment, and as her color came and wentsaid, “Is it you?”“Yes, and surely you will not shrink from me as you did when last wemet.”She held out her hand and as he pressed it, simply said, “I’m gladyou’re safe and well.”“Have you no warmer greeting for me?”“What warmer do you deserve?”“My deservings are nothing, but your own kind heart might plead for me.”“Oh, dear: the conceit of some men, who think they can pick up heartson the banks of the Chateaugay as they would acorns.”“And what of women who pitch back rings as if they stung them?”Maggie laughed and replied, “The gift is measured with the giver.”“When a gift is a token of the hour of peril, what then, my lady? Is ita thing to be scorned?”“Something to be restored to the sender when he gets out of the trap,that he may bestow it on somebody else.”“I swear I never cared for anybody else.”“Who asked you? If you must needs confess, you should have visited thefathers at the Basin on your way here.”“I’m Puritan enough to desire to confess direct to the one I haveoffended.”“So you have offended me!”“You know I care for you.”“How should I? From your many messages these last twenty months?”Morton felt vexed and Maggie observed and enjoyed his perplexity.“Come,” she said, “it is wearing on to dinner-time and I know whatsoldiers’ appetites are. We had some soldier visitors who left usnothing. We will go home.”“Not until I have said what I want to tell you,” he said warmly.“Oh, you have something to tell me! You must have. Soldiers and huntershave always long stories to tell about themselves. Keep them until youhave had some of our backwoods fare.”“Tease me no more, Maggie; my heart is yours whether you accept it ornot. That I have been neglectful and ungrateful I confess. How much Iowe you I did not know until some months after I saw you.”“You owe me nothing.”“I owe you my life.”“You owe it to Hemlock; not to me.”“I know all, brave heart. I met Mrs Scott at Kingston and she told meof your journey to Oka, but for which Hemlock would never have known ofmy peril. As she spoke, the smouldering love I had for you burst intoflame and your image has never been absent from my mind an hour since.When my comrades caroused and spoke loosely, I thought of you andturned away and tried to live worthily of you.”“You know how to praise yourself.”“No, no, my Maggie: I speak it not in praise of myself but in proof ofmy devotion, for how can a man show his love for a woman better than byforcing himself to live as he knows she would wish him to do?”“And if you so loved this somebody of yours, why did you not write her?”“You forget a soldier’s life is uncertain; I knew not the hour when Imight fall. I said to myself a thousand times, if my life is spared Iwill seek her I love and plead my cause. When the bugle sounded thecall to prepare for action I never failed to breathe an ardent prayerthat Heaven’s blessing might rest upon you. I have been spared, thesupreme hour in my life has come, and I await your answer.”Maggie stood still. Her eyes fell to the ground and her fingersunconsciously plucked to pieces the flowers they held.“Will you not speak?” pleaded Morton.In a low voice she replied, “I cannot marry.”“Why?”“I will never leave my father.”“I do not ask you should. I value his honest worth, and he shall be myfather too, for I never saw my own, he died when I was a child. Say youwill make me the happiest man on the Chateaugay and we will never part.”“I say it is time to go and get dinner ready. Father, poor man, will bestarving. Mr Morton, did you ever hoe potatoes for a forenoon?”“Nonsense; speak the word and end my anxiety.”“Oh, I’m not anxious. If you had hoed for half a day you would knowwhat hunger was.”“My hunger today is of another sort.”“Ah, well, boys ought to learn to restrain their appetites.”“Play with me no more. Let me know my fate. Give me my answer.”“Won’t it be time enough when the minister asks?”       *       *       *       *       *It was not much of a dinner that Maggie cooked, for she boiled thepotatoes without salt and fried the pork to a crisp. It did not muchmatter, however, for of the three the father was the only one who hadan appetite, and he did not complain. When done, he left to resumehis task, and the young couple were alone. At supper he was told all,when he quietly rose, gripped Morton by the hand and said nothing.Next day the two sons arrived, and, on learning the news, by wayof congratulation, slapped Maggie on the back until she declared itwas sore. There were long discussions over Morton’s plans. He toldthem he had obtained promotion after Lundy’s Lane, and as captainhis commission was worth a good deal; he would sell it, and then, asa retired officer, he would be entitled to a grant of land in UpperCanada. He proposed they should all leave and go with him. To thisfather and sons were much inclined, for the fact that the place theyoccupied was subject to seigniorial rent they did not like. It wasarranged Morton should go to Quebec and sell his commission and by thetime he returned they would be ready to join him.Four days after he had left, Maggie received a letter from him,enclosing one from Mrs Scott. He said he found that Colonel Scott hadarrived in Montreal, and, after winding up some ordnance businessthere, meant to sail for England with the Fall fleet. Mrs Scott sent apressing invitation to Maggie to come and stay with her until Mortonreturned from Quebec. Maggie went, expecting to stay ten days or so,but her visit lengthened out to the end of August. They were happyweeks, spent in enjoyable society and in the delightful task of thepreparation that is the prelude to a happy marriage. Morton at lastgot back, and had not merely the money obtained for his commission,but a patent for a large tract of land on the shore of Lake Ontario,obtained by him in a personal interview with Sir George Prevost, thegallant Gordon Drummond, his old commander, accompanying him andpressing his claim to generous recognition. Leaving Maggie in Montreal,he went again to the Chateaugay to tell all was ready. While there,he took a run up to Four Corners, his business being to visit thepoor widow whose only son had been slain in the skirmish that ledto his imprisonment. He found her and not only made sure she wouldbe cared for but instituted steps to secure a pension, for congresswas considering the question of relief to those who had suffered bythe war. During his stay at Four Corners, he lived with Mr Douglass,and repaid with earnest gratitude the advances he had made him whileliving in misery in the stable, which sad abode he looked into with aswelling heart. On the morning after his return, they were ready toembark in the three canoes that were in waiting to convey them andtheir belongings, when the old man was missed. Morton, guessing wherehe was, went to seek him, and found him kneeling by the grave of hiswife. Reverently approaching, he whispered the boatmen were anxious tostart, assisted him to rise, and, leaning heavily on his arm, led himto the canoe where he was to sit. One last look at the shanty his handshad built and the fields they had cleared, and a bend in the rivershut them out from his sight forever. Resuming his wonted contentedcheerfulness, he adapted himself to the change, and rose still higherin Morton’s esteem. When they reached the Basin, the wind was favorablefor the bateau that was waiting to leave on her trip to Lachine, andthere they arrived late in the evening. The following morning Mortonleft for Montreal with Mr Forsyth, the sons remaining to stow awaythe outfit in the bateau, which done, they also journeyed to the sameplace. That evening there was a quiet little party at Colonel Scott’squarters, and next morning a larger assemblage, for every officer offduty in the town was present, to see the army chaplain unite the happypair. When all was over and Maggie had gone to prepare for the journey,Morton received congratulations that he knew were sincere. “Why,” saidMajor Fitzjames, “she is fit to be a Duchess.”“She is fit for a more difficult position,” interjected Colonel Scott,“she has a mother-wit that stands her well alike in the circles ofpolished society and in the hour of danger and hardship.”“Who is this that is such a paragon?” asked Mrs Scott, who had justcome in.“Mrs Morton.”“Oh, say she is a true woman, and you say all. Mr Morton you have got atreasure.”“I know it,” he replied, “and I will try to be worthy of her. She willbe the benediction of the life I owe her.”The day was fine and, for a wonder, the road was good, so that alarge party, many of them on horseback, escorted the newly marriedpair to Lachine. As they drove past King’s Posts Morton recalled hisfirst visit to it, the spy, and all the painful complications that hadensued, and now so happily ended. As they stood on the narrow deck ofthe bateau, and the wind, filling the huge sail, bore them away, acheer rose, led by Colonel Scott. It was answered from the recedingboat, and Maggie waved her handkerchief.The journey was tedious and toilsome, but when they sailed into thebay on which Morton’s land was situated, saw its quality and finesituation, they felt they had been rewarded for coming so far. ThatMaggie proved an admirable help-mate need hardly be told, but whatwas remarkable is, that Morton became a successful farmer. Willing toput his hand to whatever there was to do, under his father-in-law’stuition, he quickly became proficient, and when there was work to bedone he did not say to his helpers “Go” but “Come,” and set them anexample of cheerful and persevering exertion. Having land and enoughto spare, he induced a good class of immigrants to buy from him, sothat, before twenty years, his settlement was known as one of the mostprosperous on Lake Ontario. Influential and public-spirited, Morton, ashis circumstances grew easy and did not exact the same close attentionto his personal affairs, took a leading part in laying the commercialand political foundations of Upper Canada, and Maggie was widely knownin its best society. That they were a happy couple everybody knew,and their descendants are among the most prominent subjects of theDominion.ARCHANGE AND MARIE.I.--THEIR DISAPPEARANCE.During the revolutionary war a number of Acadians left the NewEngland States for Canada, preferring monarchic to republican rule.The British authorities provided for these twice-exiled refugeeswith liberality, giving them free grants of lands and the necessarytools and implements, also supplying them from the nearest militaryposts with provisions for three years, by which time they would beself-sustaining. Some half dozen families asked for and received lotsin the county of Huntingdon and settled together on the shore of theSt Lawrence. Accustomed to boating and lumbering in their old Acadianhomes, they found profitable exercise in both pursuits in their new,and after making small clearances left their cultivation to the women,while they floated rafts to Montreal or manned the bateaux whichcarried on the traffic between that place and Upper Canada. The shantyof one of these Acadians, that of Joseph Caza, occupied a point thatran into the great river near the mouth of the LaGuerre.It was a sunny afternoon towards the end of September and the lake-likeexpanse of the river, an unruffled sheet of glassy blue, was set in aframe of forest already showing the rich dyes of autumn. It was a sceneof intense solitude, for, save the clearance of the hardy settler, noindication of human life met the gaze. There was the lonely stretchof water and the all-embracing forest, and that was all. Playingaround the shanty were two sisters, whose gleeful shouts evoked solemnechoes from the depths of the forest, for they were engaged in a gameof hide-and-seek amid the rows of tall corn, fast ripening in thesunshine. They were alone, for their father and brothers were awayboating and their mother had gone to the beaver-meadow where the cowspastured. Breathless with their play the children sat down to rest, thehead of the younger falling naturally into the lap of the older.“Archange, I know something you don’t.”“What is it?”“What we are to have for supper. Mother whispered it to me when shewent to milk. Guess?”“Oh, tell me; I won’t guess.”“Wheat flour pancakes. I wish she would come; I’m hungry.”“Let us go and meet her.”The children skipped along the footpath that led through the forestfrom the clearance to the pasture and had gone a considerable distancebefore their mother came in sight, bearing a pail.“Come to meet your mother, my doves! Ah, I have been long. The calveshave broken the fence and I looked for them but did not find them.Archange, you will have to go or they may be lost. Marie, my love, youwill come home with me.”“No, mother, do let me go with sister.”“No, you will get tired; take my hand. Remember the pancakes.”“I won’t be tired; I want to go with Archange.”“Ah, well; the calves may not have strayed far; you may go. But haste,Archange, and find them, for the sun will soon set.”The children danced onwards and the mother listened with a smile totheir shouts and chatter until the sounds were lost in the distance.On entering the house she stirred up the fire and set about preparingsupper.The sun set, leaving a trail of golden glory on the water, and she wasstill alone. The day’s work was done and the simple meal was ready.The mother walked to the end of the clearance and gazed and listened;neither sight nor sound rewarded her. She shouted their names at thehighest pitch of her voice. There was no response, save that a heron,scared from its roost, flapped its great wings above her head andsailed over the darkening waters for a quieter place of refuge.“It is impossible anything can have befallen them,” she said toherself; “the calves could not have gone far and the path is plain.No, they must be safe, and I am foolish to be the least anxious. Holymother, shield them from evil!”Returning to the house, she threw a fresh log on the fire, and placingthe food where it would keep warm she closed the door, casting onedisconsolate look across the dark water at the western sky, fromwhich the faintest glow had departed. Taking the path that led tothe pasture, she hastened with hurried step to seek her children.She gained the pasture. The cows were quietly grazing; there was noother sign of life. Her heart sank within her. She shouted, and hercries pierced the dew-laden air. There was no response. She sank uponher knees and her prayer, oft repeated, was, “Mother of pity, havecompassion on a mother’s sorrow and give me back my little ones!”The thought suddenly seized her that the children had failed to findthe calves and, in returning, had not taken the path, but sought thehouse by a nigh cut through the woods. She sprang to her feet andhastened back. Alas! the door had not been opened, and everything wasas she left it.“My God!” she cried in the bitterness of her disappointment, “I fearme the wolf garou has met and devoured my children. What shall I do?Marie, my pretty one, wilt thou not again nestle in thy mother’s bosomnor press thy cheek to mine? Holy Virgin, thou who hadst a babe ofthine own, look on me with compassion and give back to me my innocentlambs.”Again she sought the pasture, and even ventured, at her peril, tothread in the darkness the woods that surrounded it, shouting, ina voice shrill with agony, the names of the missing ones, but noanswering sound came. Heedless of her garments wet with dew, of herweariness, her need of food and sleep, she spent the night wanderingback and forth between house and pasture, hoping to find them at eitherplace, and always disappointed. The stars melted away one by one,the twitter of the birds was heard, the tree-tops reddened, and thesun again looked down upon her. She resumed the search with renewedhope, for now she could see. With the native confidence of one bornin the bush she traversed the leafy aisles, but her search was invain. There was only a strip of bush to be examined, for a great swampbounded it on one side as the St Lawrence did on the other, and intothe swamp she deemed it impossible the children could have gone. Shewas more convinced than before that a wild beast had killed them anddragged their bodies to its lair in the swamp. Stunned by this awfulconjecture, to which all the circumstances pointed, her strength lefther, and in deep anguish of spirit she tottered homewards. On comingin sight of the shanty she marked with surprise smoke rising from thechimney. Her heart gave a great leap. “They have returned!” she saidjoyfully. She hastened to the door. A glance brought back her sorrow.She saw only her husband and her eldest son.“What ails thee? Your face is white as Christmas snow. We came fromCoteau this morning and found nobody here. What is wrong?”“Joseph,” she replied in a hollow voice, “the wolf garou hath devouredour children.”“Never! Thou art mad. There is no wolf garou.”“I leave it all with the good God: I wish there was no wolf garou.”Then she told him of the disappearance of the children and of her vainsearch. Husband and son listened attentively.“Pooh!” exclaimed Caza, “they are not lost forever to us. Get usbreakfast and Jean and I will track them and have them back to theebefore long. You do not know how to find and follow a trail.”An hour later, shouldering their rifles, they set forth. The daypassed painfully for the poor mother, and it was long after sunsetwhen they returned. They had found no trace of the wanderers. They hadmet the calves, which, from the mud that covered them, had evidentlybeen in the swamp and floundered there long before they got back tosolid land at a point distant from the pasture. The father’s idea wasthat the children had been stolen by Indians. Next day the searchwas resumed, the neighbors joining in it. At nightfall all returnedbaffled, perplexed and disheartened; Caza more confident than beforethat the Indians were to blame. After a night’s rest, he set offearly for St Regis, where he got no information. Leaving there, hescoured the forest along Trout River and the Chateaugay, finding a fewhunting-camps, whose dusky inmates denied all knowledge of the missinggirls. He pursued his toilsome way to Caughnawaga and came back bythe river St Louis without discovering anything to throw light on thefate of his children. The grief of the mother who had been buoyingherself with the expectation that he would bring back the truants, isnot to be described; and she declared it would be a satisfaction toher to be assured of their death rather than longer endure the burdenof suspense. Again the father left to scour the wilderness that liesbetween the St Lawrence and the foot-hills of the Adirondacks, hopingto find in some wigwam buried in forest-depths the objects of his eagerquest. On reaching Lake Champlain he became convinced that the captorswere beyond his reach, and, footsore and broken-hearted, he sought hishome, to make the doleful report that he had not found the slightesttrace.The leaves fluttered from the trees, the snow came in flurries fromthe north, the nights grew longer and colder, and, at last, winter setin. When the wind came howling across the icy plain into which theSt Lawrence had been transformed, and the trees around their shantygroaned and wailed, the simple couple drew closer to the blazing logsand thought sadly of their loved ones, pinched with cold and hunger, inthe far-away wigwams of their heartless captors.“They will grow up heathens,” murmured the mother.“Nay, they were baptized,” suggested the father, “and that saves theirsouls. I hope they are dead rather than living to be abused by thesavages.”“Say not that, my husband; they can never forget us, and will watch achance to come back. Archange will sit on thy knee again, and I willonce more clasp my Marie to my bosom.”When bedtime came they knelt side by side, and in their devotions thewanderers were not forgotten.Time rolled on, and Caza and his wife became old people. Each yearadded some frailty, until, at a good old age, the eyes of the motherwere closed without having seen what she longed for--the return of herchildren. The husband tarried a while longer, and when he was laidto rest the sad and strange trial of their lives grew fainter andfainter in the memories of those who succeeded them, until it became atradition known to few--as a mystery that had never been solved.II.--THEIR FATE.Archange, holding Marie by the hand, on reaching the pasture, followedthe fence to find where the calves had broken out, and then tracedtheir footprints, which led to the edge of the swamp. Here shehesitated. “Marie, you stay here until I come back.”“No, no; I will go with you; I can jump the wet places, you know.”“Yes, and get tired before you go far. Wait; I’ll not be long inturning the calves back.”Marie, however, would not part from her sister, and followed her stepsas she picked her way over the swamp; now walking a fallen tree andanon leaping from one mossy tussock to another. The calves were soonsighted, but the silly creatures, after the manner of their kind, halfin play and half in fright, waited until the children drew near, whenthey tossed up their heels and ran. In vain Archange tried to headthem. Cumbered by Marie, who cried when she attempted to leave her,she could not go fast enough, and when it became so dark that it wasdifficult to see the sportive animals, she awakened to the fact thatshe must desist.“Marie, we will go home and leave the calves until morning.”“But if we don’t get them they will have no supper.”“Neither will you; let us haste home or we will not see to get out ofthe swamp.”“There is no hurry; I am tired,” and with these words Marie sat downon a log, and, pouting at her sister’s remonstrances, waited untilthe deepening gloom alarmed Archange, who, grasping the little hand,began, as she supposed, to retrace the way they had come. Marie wastired, and it now being dark, she slipped repeatedly into the water,until, exhausted and fretful, she flung herself on the broad trunk ofa fallen hemlock and burst into tears. Archange was now dreadfullyalarmed at their situation, yet it was some time before she was ableto persuade her sister to resume their journey. They moved on withdifficulty, and, after a while, the sight of solid green bush risingbefore them gladdened their strained eyes. “We have passed the swamp!”joyfully exclaimed Archange. They reached the ridge and scrambled upits side. The heart of the elder sister sank within her for she failedto recognize, in the starlight, a single familiar landmark. Could it bethat, in the darkness, she had pursued the reverse way, and, instead ofgoing towards home, had wandered farther away and crossed an arm of theswamp?“Are we near home, Archange? I’m hungry.”“My darling, I fear we will have to stay here until daylight. We’velost our way.”“No, no; mother is waiting for us and supper is ready; let us go.”“I wish I knew where to go, but I don’t. We are lost, Marie.”“Will we have no supper?”“Not tonight, but a nice breakfast in the morning.”“And sleep here?”“Yes, I will clasp you and keep you warm.”“I want my own bed, Archange,” and the child broke down and softly wept.Finding a dry hemlock knoll, Archange plucked some cedar brush, andlying down upon it, folded Marie in her arms, who, wearied and faint,fell asleep. It was broad daylight when they awoke, chilled and hungry.Comforting her sister as best she could, Archange descended to theswamp, confident that they would soon be home. She had not gone far,until she was bewildered. The treacherous morass retained no mark oftheir footprints of the night before, and she knew not whither togo. Long and painfully they struggled without meeting an indicationof home, and the fear grew in Archange’s breast that they were goingfarther and farther away from it. Noon had passed when they struckanother long, narrow, stony ridge, which rose in the swamp like anisland. Gladly they made for it, and seeking an open space, where thesunshine streamed through the interlacing foliage, enjoyed the heat, asit dried their wet garments and soothed their wearied limbs.“If we only had something to eat,” said Marie, wistfully.“Oh, we will get plenty of nuts here. See, yonder is a butternut tree,”and running; to it Archange returned with a lapful, which she brokewith a stone as Marie ate them. They satisfied her craving, and layingher head on the sunny bank she fell asleep from fatigue. As soon asher breathing showed that she was sleeping soundly her sister stolefrom her side to explore the ridge and try to discover some trace ofthe way home. She found everything strange, and the conviction settledupon her mind that they were lost and that their sole hope of escapewas in the searching-party, which she knew must be out, finding them.Little did she know that the morass their light steps had crossed wouldnot bear the weight of a man, and that they were hopelessly lost anddoomed to perish in the wilderness. Had she been alone she would havebroken down; the care of her sister sustained her. For her she wouldbear up. On returning, she found her still asleep, and as she bent overher tear-stained face and lightly kissed it, she murmured, “I will takecare of Marie and be her little mother.”The thought of home and mother nigh overcame her. Repressing the risinglump in her throat, she busied herself against her sister’s waking.She increased her store of butternuts, adding beechnuts and acorns aswell and broke them and arranged the kernels on basswood leaves, as onplates. She drew several big branches together and covered them withboughs which she tore from the surrounding cedars, and when the bowerwas complete she strewed its floor with dried ferns. She had finishedand was sitting beside Marie when the little eyes opened and weregreeted with a smile.“Oh, I have been waiting ever so long for you, Marie. We are going tohave a party. I have built a bower and laid out such a nice supper. Wewill play at keeping house.”The child laughed gleefully on seeing the arrangements, and the forestrang with their mirth as the hours sped on. When evening approachedMarie grew wistful; she wanted her mother; she wanted to go home, andArchange soothed her with patient care.“Look at the bower, Marie! See what a nice bed; won’t you lie down onit? And what stories you will have to tell mother of our happy timehere!”The child, charmed by the novelty, crept in, and laying down her curlyhead fell asleep to the crooning of her sister. The stars as they hungover the tree-tops gazed downwards in pity on the little girls claspedin each others’ arms in the sleep of innocence, and the soft southwind sighed as it swept by, sorrowing that it could not save them. Amurmuring was heard in the pine-tops.“Must they perish?” asked the guardian angel.“They must; no help can reach them,” answered Nature with a sigh.“Unwittingly they have strayed from the fold into the wilderness, thesepoor, helpless lambs, and must suffer. Only to man is given the powerto help in such extremity.”“Can you do nothing?” pleaded the angel.“Yes; I shall lighten their last hours, give them a speedy death, andprevent the tooth of ravenous beast or crawling worm touching theirpure bodies. Think me not cruel. I cannot perform the acts allotted tomankind, but am not, therefore, as some deem me, cruel and stolid; myspirit is tender, and what is in my power I’ll do.”Sad of countenance the angel turned and glided to the side of thesleeping children. Stooping over them he whispered in their ears, andthey smiled in their sleep and dreamt of home, of dancing on theirfather’s knee, of being tossed to the rafters by their brothers, andthey felt the touch of their mother’s hand and heard the sound of hervoice, and they were very happy.       *       *       *       *       *When they awoke the song of a belated greybird, perched overhead,greeted them, and they lay and listened and watched the movements of abrilliantly colored woodpecker, as it circled the trunk of a spruce.Looking into the face of her sister, Archange saw that it was pale andpinched and that her smile was wan and feeble.“Will father be here today?”“I hope so, Marie; are you tired of me?”“Oh, no; I do love you so, but I do want mother and--and--a drink ofwarm milk and a piece of bread.”“Well, perhaps you will get them soon, and we will be happy until theycome.”They rose and Archange busied herself in setting forth breakfast, butboth, though very hungry, now loathed the sight of nuts. Wandering,hand in hand, to find something more acceptable, they found in araspberry thicket a bush with a scant crop of second-growth berries.Making a little basket of the bark of the white birch they nearlyfilled it, and returning to their bower, sat down to enjoy them,fashioning out of reeds make-believe spoons and asking each other ifthey would have cream and sugar. The play went on and faint laughterwas heard. When the last berry was gone, the gnawing hunger re-awokeand the feverish heat of tongue and palate, which the acid juice hadallayed, returned. Marie would not be comforted. She wanted to gohome; she wanted her mother; she wanted food, and burying her facein her sister’s lap sobbed as if her heart would break and she wouldnot be comforted. Archange felt as if she must give way to despair,but she repressed the feeling and bore up bravely. The trials andresponsibilities of the past thirty-six hours had aged her, and, childas she was in years, she acted like a woman towards her sister, whomshe alternately soothed and tried to divert. While leaning over her, inaffected sportive mood, something soft brushed past her face and creptbetween them. It was a grey squirrel. Marie opened her weeping eyes,looked wonderingly for a moment, and then, with delighted gesture,grasped the little creature, and beaming with joy, pressed it to herlips.“It is Mignon; my own clear little Mignon! What caused you to run awayfrom me, you naughty boy?”It was a tame squirrel, Marie’s pet, which, a week before, hadscampered off to the woods. There was no doubt as to his identity, forbeside its evident recognition of Marie, it retained the collar ofcolored yarn she had braided and tied round his neck. Hunger, home andmother were forgotten in the delight of recovering her pet, for whomshe busied herself in getting breakfast, and he was soon sitting beforeher gravely disposing of the nuts she handed him, one by one.“Cannot Mignon guide us home?” she suddenly asked.“Oh, yes; Mignon knows the way; but we would have to follow him overthe trees. I am afraid you could not jump from branch to branch; I knowI could not.”“Oh, I will tie a string to him and make him walk before us,” and withpretty prattle she entered into a conversation with the squirrel,telling him how they were lost and he was to guide them home, for shewanted to take dinner with mother. Mignon gravely listened and noddedhis head as if he understood it all. Then he ran up a tree or two byway of exercise, frisked with another squirrel, peeped at Marie fromall sorts of unexpected places, and ended his capers by jumping onto her shoulder when she was not expecting him, and pretended he wasgoing to nibble her chin. Marie was delighted; Mignon had divertedher mind from her sufferings and Archange assisted by suggesting theyshould make a little house for him. Of sticks and reeds they framed itand plucking from the swamp lapfuls of ripe cat-tails they lined itwith them, making a nest soft as velvet. This done, they had to filla larder for him, and had a great hunting for all manner of nuts, andin this part of their work Mignon took great interest and pretended toassist, tho’, despite all warnings from Marie, he persisted in claspingin his forepaws the biggest butternuts and running away to bury them inout-of-the-way places. When she became tired with her exertions, Marietook a nap and Mignon curled himself up on her breast and snoozed withone eye open.Weak in strength and sick from hunger, Archange, no longer requiringto keep up appearances, flung herself down near by and wept bitterly.Why did not father come? Were they to die there alone and from want offood? Should she not try again to find the way home? She stood up, asif to consider which way to try, when her head grew dizzy and she sankdown and knew no more until she was aroused by Marie climbing over herand kissing her. She knew by the sun that it was late in the day, andrising, the sisters walked slowly and unsteadily seeking berries. Theyfound a few only and they again tried to eat nuts. They could not.Tracing the edge of the swamp they looked for blueberries, but theirseason was past. Suddenly a low bush, dotted with red berries, caughttheir sight. They found the berries small and of so peculiar a tastethat, had they not been ravenous for food, they could not have eatenthem. They picked the bush bare and went to their bower, where theyate them. A feeling of satisfaction followed, and Marie grew quiet andcontented.“Sing to me, Archange: do?” and the little maid laid her down to restand listen. Her sister sang one after another the chansons her parentshad brought with them from Acadia. She ceased and marked the satisfiedexpression that had overspread Marie’s countenance. Her eyes wereclosed and her hands folded. “Sing the Cedars’ song?” she whispered, inthe voice of one about to sleep. By that name was meant a hymn Archangehad heard at Christmas tide, when for the first time to her knowledgeshe had been in a church, having accompanied her father to the smallvillage of the Cedars. She knew not the words of the hymn, but hadcarried away the tune. High and clear rose in the air and floated faraway across the desolate swamp the song in which so many generationsof believers have expressed their love for the Holy Babe--the ancientLatin hymn, Adeste Fidelis. She sang the strain over and over againuntil a strange torpor crept upon her, and her voice grew fainter untilit ceased and her head sank beside that of Marie’s.All nature was hushed. The remains of trees, long since burned, nowgaunt and white, stood in the swamp as sentinels to guard the sleepingbabes, and the giant pines, beneath whose cover they rested, seemed tolift up their hands to Heaven in silent pleading. Slowly yet surely theberries of the dread ground-hemlock did their work; stealthily as juiceof mandrake or of poppy. The leaden hours of the long September nightpassed and inky clouds blotted out the stars, and when the sun rose heshot out a shaft of purplish light, which revealed the faces of thesisters, calm and cold in death, with Mignon whisking his head againstthe whitened cheek of his sweet mistress.There was a roll of distant thunder; nearer and nearer it came; it grewdarker and the air was hot and stifling. The forest groaned, and thenthere was an appalling crash and a blaze of lightning clad the scenein dazzling sheen. There was the red glow of fire; the bolt had strucka dead pine and instantly the surrounding trees, covered with witheredleaves, that caught like tinder, were in a blaze. The storm shrieked,the thunder made the earth tremble, the rain fell in torrents, buthigher and higher mounted the flames. It was the funeral pyre ofArchange and Marie, and when it died out not a vestige of them was tobe found.THE SETTLER’S FIRST GRIST.CHAPTER I.Late in the fall of 1817 seven families of immigrants settled on thebanks of the St Lawrence in Dundee, close to the St Anicet line andnearly opposite the village of Lancaster. With one exception, theyhad come from the Isle of Skye, and they named their settlement aftertheir Scottish birthplace, which was not altogether inappropriate, forthe strip of territory they had taken possession of was so surroundedon the land side by swamps as to be, in a sense, an island. Apartfrom two or three of their number who knew a little English, theyspoke Gaelic and Gaelic only. They brought naught beyond strong armsand great endurance of privation, for their training as crofters andfishermen was of little use in their new surroundings. An untroddenwilderness of forest hemmed in their shanties, which were placed onthe bank of the St Lawrence, and on the other side of the great river,which here expands into a lake two miles in width, were their nearestneighbors, who had shown them the greatest kindness. Highlanders likethemselves, the people on the Glengarry side of the river had taken alively interest in the newcomers, had made bees to give them a freshstart in life; crossed over the river to show them how to fell trees,build shanties, and make potash, and when spring came had, with trueHighland generosity, lent them seed and assisted in brushing it in orplanting it amid the stumps of their clearings. In the black mould ofthe virgin soil the potatoes grew with an abundance that surprisedthe Skyemen, though their astonishment was greater at the luxurianceof the Indian corn, which they saw for the first time, and at theexcellence of the wheat. When the latter was threshed the next stepwas to get it ground. Their nearest mill was at Williamstown, in thecounty of Glengarry, and to reach it involved a fatiguing journey. Itwas a bright morning in the first week of October, 1818, that one ofthe settlers placed a bag of wheat in a canoe to take to this mill. Itwas his first grist--the first in his life of wheat--and he looked atthe bag, as he deposited it carefully in the bottom of the canoe, withsatisfaction not unmingled with honest pride, which was shared in byhis wife and children, who came to the water’s edge to see him off.Assisted by his son, a handsome young fellow, the paddles were dipped,and the boat was soon skimming lake St Francis, for so the expansionof the St Lawrence between Cornwall and Coteau is named. When half-wayacross they paused to rest, and as they viewed the noble sheet ofwater, embedded in a setting of bush whose bright colors glowed in theshimmering sunshine of a true Canadian fall day, they thought they hadnever seen anything more beautiful. “And the best of it is, Allan, thatthe water is fresh and not salt, and,” fixing his gaze on his shanty,which he could discern beneath the trees, “the land is our own, andthere will be no rent to pay at Martinmas.”When they got to the mill they found there were other customers beforethem, and having to wait their turn, it was nearly dark when theircanoe passed out of the river Raisin into lake St Francis on theirhomeward journey. The sun had set behind a cloud, and the lake, thoughcalm, had an oily appearance--both signs of a coming change. They hadgone far enough to lose sight of the shore they had left, when a slightswell of the waters was noticed, and immediately afterwards the hollowsound of approaching wind. Both practised boatmen of the Old World,they knew what these signs meant. “Had we our old boat, Allan,” saidthe father, “I would not care for the squall that’s coming, but thiscockle-shell will not stand a rough sea. It may soon blow over. YonderI think I see the light your mother has set in the window to guide us.We will hurry before the waves get big.” Urged by their strong arms,the canoe flew over the lake, but swifter came the storm, and beforemany minutes a violent gust of wind, accompanied by pelting rain, burstupon them. Like all shallow sheets of fresh water, the lake was quicklybeaten into a fury, and before long waves large enough not merely totoss the boat but to drench its occupants were coursing over it. Thedanger of swamping was imminent when the father’s skill averted it.Directing his son to stretch himself full length in the bottom ofthe canoe, using the bag of flour as a pillow, it steadied under theliving ballast. Then, taking his place at one end, the father broughtthe other bow-on the wind and skilfully kept it, by vigorous use ofthe paddle, in a line with the waves, so that the canoe breasted andslipped over them, hardly shipping a drop of water. The fury of thesquall soon passed, and was succeeded by a gale which blew steadilyfrom the west. With that fine respect for parents which characterizesHighlanders, Allan had offered no suggestion, obediently doing what hisfather ordered. When he heard him say to himself “My God, we are lost!”he exclaimed: “No, father, the storm will blow by, and we will thenmake our way home this night yet.”“Yes, the storm will blow over, but where will we be then? You forget,my poor boy, that the lake ends in rapids, and we are hurrying towardsthem as fast as wind and wave can drive us. Your mother and yoursisters and brothers will have sore hearts tomorrow.”Allan had not thought of the rapids. On their way from Montreal he hadseen them, watched their foaming surges, and knew their canoe couldnot live a moment among them. The thought of death was bitter to him,and as the hours passed and they went drifting downwards, amid thestorm and darkness, towards the jaws of the dreaded danger, his heartwas filled with anguish, not alone for his mother, his brothers andsisters, but for her with whom he had secretly plighted troth.“Allan, I will shout to you when I see the rapids. Jump and try to makethe shore, for it may be near; do not trouble with me, or we both maybe lost. Be a good lad to your mother, and tell her and your brothersand sisters my last thoughts were of them.”CHAPTER II.Mrs McDonald had tidied up the one and only room of the shanty, andwas expecting momentarily the arrival of her husband and son, when shewas terror-struck by the unlooked for sound of the squall among thetrees. Hurrying from the house, she stood on the beach, on which thewaves were beginning to break, but the darkness and rain preventedher seeing many yards. In her agony of apprehension she shouted, inthe hope that the missing ones were near: from the stormy waters cameno reply. Bidding her children, who had followed her, to go and alarmthe neighbors, very soon every soul in the settlement was by her side,talking rapidly in Gaelic and excitedly suggesting what ought to bedone. They were all agreed that if the canoe was on the lake when thestorm burst she was lost, and their sole hope was she had not left theother shore. The only other canoe they had was no larger than the onethat was gone, and to launch it in order to search the lake, would beto add to the calamity. All that could be done was to build a bonfireon the most prominent point, to guide the missing canoe if withinsight, and hope for the best. Laying his hand on Mrs McDonald’s arm,as she stood wistfully gazing on the now foaming waters of the lake,the oldest man of the settlement said, “Come with us out of the coldand wet; we can do no good here.” Gathered in the shanty, the fire wasreplenished until it roared in the ample chimney, and the neighborstalked hopefully to the family and despondently among themselves. Whenthe hope that the storm was only a passing squall was dissipated by itssettling into a gale, under the influence of which the waves lashed thesandy beach with a roar so appalling that it stifled the groaningsof the forest, the men agreed among themselves that McDonald and hisson were at the bottom of the lake, and their hearts grew sore forthose whom they believed to be widowed and orphaned by the calamity.Fighting with her fears, Mrs McDonald tried to persuade herself allwould come right, and assumed a complacency she was far from feeling.“Often,” she remarked, “has my husband been out worse nights than thisin Scotland, and surely he who could fight the Atlantic is not goingto be drowned in a bit freshwater loch in Canada. To be sure there wasa winding-sheet in the candle last night, but that did not signify,seeing that it was made from the fat of a wild deer, and not from thatof a Christian sheep. Not one of my family, and it goes far back, MrsMcGillis, ever died without the wraith of Ian Ban, our forbear, who waslaird of Glenish, being seen, and it is not to be said he failed towarn me when my husband and oldest son were near their end. I am notafraid of them. They will be here tomorrow--Donald, like a good man,go and see that the fire is blazing on the point--and we must keep ourcomposure. What is that?”Close to the dwelling rose a prolonged howl, beginning at a low pitchand rising to a piercing climax, the sound of which blanched everyface. Those nearest the door opened it; none ventured out. Every earwas strained. In a few minutes the howl was repeated. “Pooh!” said ayoung man, “it is only a wolf.”The incident broke the tension of suspense, and one after another begantelling stories of their old life in Skye, having more or less bearingon the situation of those they waited for. Thus the hours wore away,and it was noted with satisfaction that at the turn of the night thegale broke and speedily died away. The waves still ran too high forthe canoe to be launched to attempt to gain the other side of the lakeand make enquiries, but they were falling fast. When it was agreed itwould be safe to go, the settlers again gathered on the beach, whichwas reddened by the beacon fire that still blazed. There was unexpecteddelay; a paddle was found to be broken, and another had to be made,and ere all was ready a faint whitening of the eastern sky told ofthe coming day. It was now a beautiful night, calm and still, theglassy swells of the lake reflecting the sparkle of the stars. Many asearching glance was cast across the broad lake for the missing boat,and dreadful apprehensions filled each bosom as to the secret its darkwaters kept. The canoe was about to start, the two men going with herhad dipped their paddles, and the group on the beach clustered closerto see her off, when, faint and from afar, came over the surface ofthe lake a plaintive murmur. Not a word was uttered, but every ear wasstrained to catch the sound. It came again fitfully. Neighbor lookedwith agony into the blanched face of neighbor. The one idea possessedthem, that it was the dirge of the spirits of their departed friendsas they were journeying to the place of souls. The mother impulsivelysprang forward until the water laved her feet and cried, “My Allan, myfirst-born, is it you that is calling? Oh speak to me and tell where inthe cold deep I will find you.”There was a shriek behind her which froze every heart. A young woman,the winsome daughter of one of the settlers, had fallen senseless onthe sand.The patriarch of the settlement who, at the first sound, had kneltand placed his ear close to the lake, soon rose in stern reproof. “Isit thus you welcome God’s mercy? Your son, Mrs McDonald, and yourlover, Flora, for so you have just revealed to us he is, is alive andwell. It is his voice singing the boat-song of the Isle of Mist, and Ihear the plash of oars.” And so it was, for now clear and strong camefrom the lake the words of the song, and soon keen eyes could see theapproaching canoe. There was a shout of joy, and tears streamed fromevery cheek. A few minutes more and the lost were among them.When they had re-entered the shanty and the cup of rejoicing had goneround, Mr McDonald told his story. As time passed, and the canoedrifted farther down the lake, he had given up all hope and expectedevery moment to feel it caught in the strong current that leads to therapids, and to hear their dreadful sound. “I was praying for you in myheart,” he said, “when I heard the sound of breaking water. Allan, Ishouted, here they are at last; make ready to jump and swim for yourlife. No sooner said than my paddle struck bottom and I saw treesbefore me. Quick, Allan, jump and we will drag the canoe ashore. Weboth sprang out at the same time, and catching hold of the canoe ranher through the breakers and high on to the bank. We were wet and socold, but, oh, we were thankful that we were saved. After a while wegot up and moved round to see if a house was near, when we found thatwe were on one of the small islands that lie at the head of the rapids.A few rods one way or the other and we would have swept past it andbeen lost. It was God’s own hand that had steered our canoe. Well, wewaited patiently till the gale went down, and as soon as we dared welaunched out again and paddled homeward. And a long pull we had, but itwarmed us.”The bag of flour was opened. The water had caked the outside layer,leaving the interior quite dry. The flour was examined with interest,being the first from wheat grown in the settlement.“Well,” exclaimed the patriarch, “it is time we were in our beds,though it be now good daylight, and we will go to sleep with thankfulhearts that our good neighbor is with us and not at the bottom of thelake. And you, Mrs McDonald, we wish well to, for you have this morningfound not only the son that was lost, but a daughter you knew not of,and a good girl she is too. There is plenty of land here for all, andwe will build them a house and hold our New Year in it, and, pleaseGod, we will not again risk life in these French cobbles of canoes, butbuild a big boat.”And so it came to pass. The New Year beheld Flora and Allan made onewith a merry-making that became a tradition in the settlement, theirGlengarry friends driving over the icy bosom of the lake to it in adrove, and bringing two pipers to supply the music, and when springcame a boat, large enough to carry half a dozen bags of flour, builtafter the best Isle of Skye design, was launched in the creek besidethe shanty of William McPhee, and served the settlement many a longyear.ABNER’S DEVICE.“Abner, I want you to go a message for me after breakfast.”“Yes, mother. Is it to Four Corners?”“No; you are to go to the Blands, with a basket for old Mrs Whiting.”“Why, that’s in Canada, and they’re our enemies.”“Our governments are at war, but we old neighbors are not.”“But the Indian guard may catch me.”“If they do, they’ll not harm a boy like you.”“Yes, they would, mother. They’d scalp anything that’s Yankee, and Ihate them and every Britisher. I don’t see why you want to do a goodturn to those who’ve been trying these two years to cut our throats andburn our houses.”“Abner!” exclaimed Mrs Smith reproachfully.“I want to hit them every time, mother, and if I have got to go, you’lllet me take father’s rifle.”“No, Abner; you’ll go as you are, and if the Indian guard fall inwith you, their captain will let you go when you tell your errand. Ifcongress want to fight king George, that’s not to say we are to hateand hurt those we have lived beside so long and who’ve done us many akindness.”This conversation took place in the log shanty of a first settler innorthern New York in the fall of 1813. War was then in progress, anda few days before General Hampton had returned from his attempt toreach Montreal, and with his withdrawal to winter quarters the settlersalong the frontier supposed hostilities were ended for the season.When war had been declared the settlers on the American side of thelines were in terror of being visited by the Indians, whom the Britishgovernment had enrolled to watch the frontier, but as time proved theirapprehensions groundless, they were little affected by the contest thatwas being waged, beyond having their intercourse with the settlerson the Canadian side restricted, and that intercourse had been closeand frequent, for the difference in allegiance had not affected theirfriendship. In the bush distance goes for little, and though five milesapart, the Blands were Mrs Smith’s nearest neighbors to the north,and their relation had been of the warmest kind. Unable, owing to thepresence of Hampton’s camp at Four Corners, to do their trading there,Mrs Smith knew that the Blands must be without groceries and evenflour, and, at this, the first opportunity, she was eager to send themsome little comforts to vary their coarse fare, especially for MrsWhiting, the grandmother of the household, who was often bedridden fromrheumatism.The basket was ready for Abner by the time he had finished breakfast.His imagination had been fired by seeing the soldiers at fort Hickoryand at Four Corners, and to carry the basket in the usual way was outof the question. Securing thin withe-ropes, made from the bark of themoosewood, he slung the basket on his shoulders like a knapsack, andcatching up a cedar pole he grasped it as if it were a musket, andshouting to himself the order, “Eyes front; right foot forward; quickmarch!” off he set, fancying himself one of Colonel Purdy’s crackbrigade. Mrs Smith as, from the door, she watched her boy depart on hiserrand, while she smiled at his wayward fancy, could not help feelinga thrill of pride in his lithe, active figure, giving promise of ahandsome man. That he was shrewd and quick-witted, as well as tall andstrong, for his years, she well knew.The weather had been extremely wet for the season; the ground wassoaked and the leaves had long ago been washed from all the treesexcept the beech. During the night the rain had ceased, and themorning, dull and hazy, gave promise of a dry day. Once out of hisfather’s clearance, Abner’s way lay through the bush. There was afoot-track that led to the Blands, but now it was so hidden by thelitter of leaves that it was indiscernible. That did not signify. Bornin the woods, they were so familiar that Abner could find his way inany direction he chose, with as much ease as the dwellers in citiestraverse their intricacies of streets and lanes. As he threaded hisway among the trees, the chatter of the chipmunk, the whirr of thepartridge, and the tapping of a belated woodpecker were the only soundsthat fell on his ear, and no sight more unusual than an occasionalgrey-squirrel or troop of deer. When he had crossed the line thatdivides Chateaugay from Hinchinbrook, and was fairly on Canadianterritory, he became more circumspect, and his fancy changed. He wasno longer the right-hand man of a file of soldiers, but a scout, sentinto the enemy’s country to get information. Keeping under every coverthat offered, looking furtively around before venturing to cross anyopen that came in his way, treading on the hardest ground he couldfind, and doubling on his track where the soil treacherously retainedhis footprints, he found playing at Abner the spy much more excitingthan that of Abner the soldier. Suddenly a crackling sound arrested hisfootsteps. It was, he knew, no noise made by any denizen of the forest,and he turned towards whence it came. Soon he caught the faint odor ofsmoke, and then he knew there was a fire near--probably the camp-fireof the British guard. Prudence whispered to him to turn away and passon; curiosity, to go and have a peep at the camp. He was only a boyof fourteen, and curiosity carried the day. Slowly he stole towardsthe point whence the crackling sound of blazing branches came, and sonoiselessly that even the squirrels failed to start at his approachuntil he passed their perch. Now he could see the smoke, and nextthe glare of the embers. He thought he saw the figure of a man, butas, when he looked again, the shape was gone, he thought he had beenmistaken. He paused to listen. There was no sound save the drumming ofa partridge behind him. Redoubling his caution, he crawled towards thespot whence the smoke rose, and when he slowly lifted his head frombehind a thicket, he was startled to find himself looking into a campof the dreaded Indian guard, of whom he had so often heard but neverseen. There they were, 21 in number, lying prostrate in sleep in acircle around the fire and the pale autumn sunshine streaming down uponthem. Uncouth looking men they were, with daubs of paint on their facesthat made them hideous. Beside each one lay his musket, and some even,in their sleep, grasped their hatchets, prepared, if surprised, forimmediate combat. Their captain Abner recognized from his being whiteand wearing the sword and crimson sash of a British officer. With eagereye Abner scanned the unexpected scene, and when the first feelingof fear died away, he grew bold and thought of what he might haveaccomplished had his mother allowed him to take his father’s riflewith him. The exploits of Robert Rogers and Ethan Allen floated beforehis mind’s eye and he planned how, had he been armed, he might haveshot the captain through the heart and have disappeared before any ofthe sleeping group knew what had happened. Satisfied with the sight, hemoved to withdraw and resume his journey. At the first attempt to turnaround, his arms were seized with a grasp of iron, and, looking up,he saw he was in the hands of an Indian, whose painted visage glaredwith ferocity. Appalled for a moment, Abner stood still, then he madea wrench to get away. It was in vain. Drawing the boy’s arms together,the Indian grasped them by the wrists with his left hand, and when theright hand was thus released he thrust it into the folds of his beltof wampum. Abner’s eyes followed the movement, and when the hand waswithdrawn grasping a short, thick knife, which he recognized as thescalping-knife he had heard so much of, a paroxysm of terror smote him,and he gave a piercing shriek. With a diabolical grin, as if he enjoyedthe boy’s terror, the Indian passed the knife before Abner’s eyes andtried its edge on his soft chubby cheek, then flourished it beforeplunging into his scalp. As he made the motion, a billet of wood camehurtling past, and striking the Indian on the head, he fell, draggingAbner down with him. He was lifted up by the captain, whom Abner hadseen asleep a minute before, and as he passed his hand over him to makesure he was unhurt, he poured forth a torrent of angry words, in hisown language, at the Indian, who gave no sign that the knockdown blowhe had received had hurt him. As the captain led Abner into the circleof Indians, who had been awakened by his shriek, he told him he hadbeen scolding his assailant for attempting to scalp him, and said inapology that he was a heathen Indian of the far west, a Blackfoot whohad strayed to the Ottawa, and joined a band of the Iroquois. “I do notallow my men to be cruel; my orders be to watch the frontier to preventinvasion by your soldier, and not to hurt anybody.” Then he askedAbner who he was and why he had come nigh their camp, and was answeredfrankly.“Ah, my leetle man,” said the captain, who spoke with a Frenchaccent, “if you tell me true you get away; but I’m afraid you carryletter,--despatch--eh!” Taking the basket from his back, the captainlifted out its contents, among which were half-a-dozen apples, then aluxury in the new settlement, where the few fruit trees planted had notbegun to bear. An Indian snatched up one and took a bite, laughinglysaying, “Yankee apple better nor Yankee bullet.” The other contentswere of as innocent a description: a few little luxuries that mighttempt an invalid, a small bag of flour, and a bottle of liniment.The captain, satisfied there was no letter in the basket, carefullyreplaced its contents, and then examined Abner’s clothing, making himeven take off his shoes. While thus engaged an Indian slouched upbeside the captain and, throwing down his musket, began to speak tohim, and Abner listened to the guttural sounds with awe.“Dis man,” said the captain, “tell me he see you leave clearance andfollow you. He say, when you come to Canada side you act as ’fraid,hide behind bush, and walk ve-ray fooney. Why you no want to be seen?”Abner blushed at this description of his enacting the role of Indianscout and perceived how his conduct could be misconstrued. Heremembered, also, his mother’s repeated injunction that truth is betterunder any circumstances, and, with a shamed smile on his face, he toldwhat he was doing. The captain grinned as he listened and patting Abneron the back said: “I know; boy once myself and now fadder of four; youplay one leetle game of Indian spy, not tinking real Indian watch you.You one good, honest-faced boy. Pity you Yankee.”The Indian who had tracked him, smiled as the captain spoke, showing heunderstood English, and, like all his race, enjoyed banter. “You smellsmoke, eh?” he said, “hold up nose and go on. Then you hear partridgedrum (here he imitated the sound) me partridge and signal to Joe; Joesteal up behind, catch arms, pull out knife, you--squeal,” and here, asif overcome by the ludicrousness of the scene, the Indian grinned fromear to ear without emitting a single sound of laughter, and poked Abnerin the side.“You make big mistake tink you come to Indian camp without we know,”remarked the captain, “when we sleep, sentinel all round like fox.”Changing the subject, the captain tried to get from Abner what he knewof the movements and whereabouts of the American army, particularlyof the number still in camp at Four Corners, which Abner admitted hehad visited the day before. It was without avail. The boy realized theinformation he would give might be used against his countrymen, and heanswered evasively. “Ah, well,” exclaimed the captain, “it no matter;we’ve our spies in your camp so well as in de bush.”The Indians were now busily preparing breakfast, and Abner watched themwith curious eyes as they placed potatoes and pieces of pork to cookupon the hot embers, while a copper-kettle with tea was slung on acrooked stick. Their duties required them to be on the patrol along thefrontier during the night, which accounted for their sleeping so late.“Vell,” said the captain, “what you tink of dese Indian? Yankee able tocatch ’em? Eh? You tell, when you get home, what great fellow Indiansbe. Now you may go, and give Mrs Bland de compliment of Captain deVersailles and say he will do her de honor of taking supper with her.”Thus permitted to resume his journey, Abner struck into the bush, andin half an hour had reached the house of the Blands. He was hailedwith an uproarious welcome from every member of the large household,for there was the delight not only of resuming long-suspended friendlyintercourse, but the proof in his appearance that the warfare wagedbetween the two governments had not lessened the goodwill of theirneighbors. Unpacking the basket, it was found to contain a little ofeverything they had been so long deprived from being shut out from theAmerican stores. On the cork being drawn from the bottle of liniment,granny declared that the very smell had done her rheumatics good. Asthe contents of the basket lay spread on the table, a sudden thoughtseemed to strike Mrs Bland, which she communicated in a whisper to herhusband. There was a quiet consultation, and then she addressed Abner.“We have something strange to tell you, and mum’s the word. Nightbefore last, when we were asleep, a knock came to the door and then itwas pushed open. Father rose, stirred the fire, and got a light, whenwe saw it was an American soldier. He was drenched to the skin, for itwas pouring rain, and, oh, what a pale, thin ghost he looked! He creptup to the fire and sank in a heap beside it, muttering, ‘Thank God.’ Isaw he was perishing, and got some hot drink for him, and after a whilehe told his story. He had been with Hampton’s army in the battle, wherehe had received a flesh wound in the side, and when Purdy’s brigadefell back he was unable to keep up with them, got separated from hiscompany, and, in the dark, lost his way. Next morning he tried to findthe trail of the army, but failed, and then, guided by the sun, strucksouth, knowing he would in time reach the States. Too weak to carrythem, he threw away his musket and ammunition, and crawled, ratherthan walked. When the last biscuit in his haversack was eaten, he hadto trust to beech and butter nuts, though he was not hungry, for hiswound fevered him. Often he lay down, thinking he would never riseagain, but he was young and strong, and when he revived a little hepushed on, until, to his great joy, he struck our clearing. He thoughthe was in the States, and when we told him our house was on the Canadaside he was dreadful afraid we would give him up, and he would be sentto Montreal as a prisoner. We soon eased him on that score; our bigtrouble was to hide him from the Indian guard until we could get himsent across the lines.”“Yes, mother,” interrupted one of her sons, “they came to our house thenext day, and are close by yet.” Abner shivered.“Well,” resumed Mrs Bland, “I made the poor Yank take off his wetclothes and lie down in our warm bed. I dressed his wound for the firsttime, and it was raw and nasty, I can tell you, and then he fell asleeplike a baby, poor fellow. I cleaned and set his clothes to dry, and asI sat mending them next morning father and I consulted. To keep him inthe house was to give him up to the Indians, and he was too weak totravel farther. Where to hide him until he was able to leave botheredus, when, all of a sudden, father thought of the big platform thatstands near the spring in the bush, two acres back, which the Indiansraised last year for still hunting. It was late in the day when heawoke, and he found himself weak as water but the fever had left him.We told him what we intended, and, after he had eaten something, fatherand the boys carried him to the platform, rolled him in a blanket andcovered him with elm bark and cedar brush. We have taken him victualsafter dark, and last night, seeing it was wet, we fetched him over andgave him a night’s rest in bed. He eats little, for his stomach isturned against our common food, and he’ll be glad of what your motherhas sent. Now, Ab, can’t you think of some plan to get this poor fellowacross the lines?”He could not think of any, for the woods were full of Indians, but hewould like to visit the wounded soldier. Preparing as tasty a repast asshe could out of the victuals sent by Mrs Smith, Abner and Mrs Blandstarted for his place of concealment. As is their custom, the Indianshad raised the platform in a thicket, which commanded a runway, and wastherefore well concealed, and, what was of equal consequence at thatseason, sheltered from the wind. On coming beneath it, Mrs Bland spoke,when there was a movement above, and a face, so ashy pale and wastedthat Abner felt a creeping feeling pass over him, peered from beyondthe edge. “Here’s a boy from Yankeetown and a dinner cooked from theprovisions he has brought.”“He’s welcome,” faintly whispered the soldier. “I wish I could go backwith him.”Taking the basket in one hand, Abner climbed up to the platform withthe agility of a squirrel, and helped the soldier to raise himself andarrange the food. When he saw the wheaten bread, he said it put him inmind of home, and he fell to and made the best meal he had partaken ofsince the fatal day on the Chateaugay. His strength returned with thegrateful food and he asked Abner many questions, what Hampton had doneafter the battle, where he was now, were many killed, did the Britishfollow him up, and were there many Indians in the woods. When he heardof Abner’s encountering the Indians that morning, he shuddered, andAbner could not help thinking of what his fate would be did one of themferret out his retreat, a reflection that increased his desire to savehim. Leaving the soldier in a cheerful and hopeful mood, he slippedback to the Blands, puzzling his head to devise some plan of rescuinghis countryman.After dinner, which consisted of corn boiled in milk, and potatoeswith fried venison, the Bland boys proposed to go partridge shooting,and Abner agreed, as he was in no hurry to return home. So off theywent. In beating the woods, a coon was started, and it supplied theidea Abner had been seeking for. Before they returned home he hadworked it out and determined to submit it to Mrs Bland. On approachingthe door they heard peals of laughter, when one of the boys remarked,“The captain has come; he’s a jolly one with the girls,” and onentering, they found that personage entertaining the family in hisliveliest style. Abner bit his lip and saw he must bide his time.Supper is an early meal in the backwoods, and after enjoying it tothe full, and diverting and flattering each of the household, CaptainVersailles, with many apologies for duty requiring him to leave suchdelightful company, left to return to his Indians. No sooner had hegone, than Abner asked abruptly, “These moonlight nights don’t you gocoon-hunting?”“Don’t we, Ab,” answered one of the boys, “think you’d say so if yousaw the skins nailed on the barn-door.”“Well, then, I’ve a plan to get the soldier away with me,” which heproceeded to lay before them. Briefly it was, that the boys should gowith their guns a mile or so east and close to the boundary-line, whenthey would begin firing and shouting. The Indians, thinking it was anattack from Fort Hickory, would hurry to meet the invaders, leaving thewestern part of the frontier unguarded, and let Abner slip across withthe soldier.“It’s feasible,” said Mr Bland, “the trouble is the poor fellow isn’table to walk a rod, let alone five miles.”“He’ll die from cold if left out longer,” remarked his wife; “we mustrun some risk. He might be able to keep on the back of the old whitemare.”“That’s so,” answered her husband, “we’ll try Ab’s plan.”As no time was to be lost, it being essential to make the diversionbefore the Indians were detailed by Captain Versailles to their postsfor the night, the boys caught up their guns and left, while Abner andMr Bland slipped over to the hiding-place of the soldier, told himwhat was intended, and helped him down from his perch. The prospect ofspeedy escape gave him unwonted strength, and leaning on his friendshe managed to walk to the house, where Mrs Bland, after dressing hiswound, insisted on washing his face and tidying him up. “For sure,” shesaid, “you’re going home to your friends, and you mustn’t give Canada abad name.”“That I never will,” murmured the grateful soldier, “God has anointedthe hearts of both peoples with the same oil of kindness, and it’s onlythe politicians and big men on both sides that make trouble between us.”The evening was calm and mild for the season, and Mr Bland satlistening by the open door. Presently, there burst from a remote cornerof the woods, a sharp volley, followed by such shouts and cries aswould lead the listener to fancy a fierce fight was in progress. “Therethey are!” exclaimed Mr Bland, while the shots and uproar continued toincrease, “let ’em keep that up for five minutes, and there won’t be anIndian within earshot who won’t be running to the spot.”The noise did continue that long and longer too, while, with skilfulimitation, it subsided and increased, and passed from one part of thewoods to another, the cheers of soldiers mingling with equally goodimitations of Indian yells, giving the impression of a running fightbetween a detachment of the American garrison and the Indian guard.When Mr Bland considered all the Indians had left for the neighborhoodof the supposed fight, the old mare was brought to the door, which thesoldier was helped to mount, and Abner, grasping the bridle, led theway. By this time the moon was high enough to be pouring down its raysthrough the tree-tops, and though its light was useful in showing himhow to avoid obstacles and to go much faster than they otherwise couldhave done, Abner would have dispensed with it for fear of its revealingtheir presence to the Indians. His fear was groundless. His device wasa complete success. Not an Indian was met, the woods were traversedin safety, and Abner exulted in the thought how he had tricked theIndians, and almost laughed right out when he pictured to himself theirdisgust, on reaching the scene of the supposed fight, to find it tobe only a coon-hunt. If they had trapped him in the morning, he hadoutwitted them in the evening. When the light of his father’s house wasdiscerned, Abner relieved his feelings by a great shout of exultation,that drew his parents to the door.“Well, Abner, you see the Indians did not catch you?”“Didn’t they mother! I feel the clutch of one of ’em at my scalp yet.Won’t you help the stranger down, father? He is a soldier and wounded.”“Wounded! Poor critter, I must get the bed ready,” and Mrs Smith dartedindoors.Stiff and sore from the exertion and cold, the poor soldier was liketo fall when they helped him off the mare, and, gently, father and soncarried him to the bed.“Poor man, ain’t he tuckered out!” exclaimed Mrs Smith, as sheapproached him when his head had been laid on the pillow. Shading thecandle she glanced at him, started, looked again, and crying out,“Blessed if it ben’t my own brother Bill from Varmont!” she fell on hisneck in a paroxysm of hysterical sobs. And so it turned out to be. Hehad been among those last drafted to reinforce Hampton, and had beenunconscious that his sister lived so near the camp at Four Corners.Abner was the hero of the night when the soldier told how he had beenthe means of saving him. “No,” said the lad modestly, “it was mother’ssending me against my will to the Blands that saved you.”“That’s so, Abner, and you never forget it, that blood is thicker thanwater, and in doing a kind deed to those you considered an enemy wewere serving ourselves.”WHAT A SETTLER TOLD ME.After the stifling heat and blinding glare of a Canadian summer day,it is most refreshing to walk forth as the sun, shorn of its strength,sinks, a glowing ball of fire, behind the forest that edges thelandscape. Vegetation, wilted by the day’s glaring heat, revives withthe dewy coolness of the hour, and from the neighboring bush comes thesong of the greybird. As the glow fades from the sky, nowhere else inthe world of tenderer blue or more translucent depth, the stars dropinto sight, and should Venus be in the ascendant, she burns with awhite flame unknown at any other season. Generally, with the settingof the sun, a light breeze springs up from the west or northwest,refreshing to the farmers who toiled throughout the sultry day, andswaying the heads of timothy until the meadows seem to be swept bybillows. The eye of the saunterer takes in the scene, passing over thegreat flat fields of grain and grass, until ended by the recurringbelt of bush; the snug farm-houses set amid shade-trees and orchards;the pond-like reaches of the Chateaugay, sleeping peacefully in thehollows of its rounded banks, unruffled save as the wing of one of theswallows, that skim its glassy surface, frets it for a moment, or fromthe leap of an inhabitant of its clear waters; and, in the finishedbeauty of the picture, he finds it hard to realize that he is lookingupon the results of the labor of scarce half a century, that underneatha few of the roofs before him still live men and women who saw thecountry when a wilderness of forest and swamp, and who are survivorsof the generation who wrought the wondrous change--men and women whounderwent privations the most painful and labors the most exhaustingin making the country what it is. To give those who have inheritedthe fruits of their sacrifices some idea of what the first settlersunderwent, I here submit the narrative of one of them, as nearly as maybe in the words I was told it:You have driven a long way to see me, sir, and I am afraid I cantell you little worth the hearing. It is strange you should go toso much trouble to gather these old-time stories, but if I can tellyou anything that will be of use to you I am willing. You want me tobegin with our leaving the Old Country and go on in order, as you canrecollect best that way. Very well, only you will have to come andsee me again, for it is a long story, and if you print any of it, youare to change it so that nobody will know who told you. I don’t mindmyself, but some of my children might not like it.We belonged to the Border, and the first sight that met my eyes everymorning was the Eildon hills. My husband was a shepherd and we livedwell enough until our family began to grow large, and then we thoughtit would be well for their sake to try Canada. We had a little savedand that, with what we got from the roup of our furniture, paid ourpassage and plenishing. We sailed from the Solway, into which a bigship from Liverpool called for a party of emigrants. We were rowedout in small boats, and when I got on to her deck my heart failedme, for such dirt and confusion I never saw the like, crowded as shewas with 242 emigrants from county Kerry, who had gone on board atLiverpool. This we never expected, but it was too late now, and wehad to make the best of it. The sight below was worse than above, andI turned fairly sick when I went down the ladder to our berths; thenoise was bad enough but the smell was just awful. The mate, a swearingcharacter, was not without a show of decency, and did the great favorof allotting to us Border folks, who numbered an even six dozen, therow of berths aft the main hatchway, so that we were kept together. Weslipped out of the firth that night with the tide, and next morning,which was a most beautiful day, we kept tacking off and on the coastof the North of Ireland. As we got out on the ocean I grew sea-sick,and for a few days I was just in misery; having to attend the childrenyet hardly able to raise my head. The ship’s provisions were scantyand very bad, which did not matter much to us, for we had taken a gooddeal with us, but the poor Irish, who had brought nothing, were alwayswanting to borrow, and as we, not having more than enough to serveourselves, had to refuse, they abused us for being proud, and tried topick quarrels, but both the Scotch and English of us kept our tempersand gave them no offence. Their jealousy and ill-feeling grew, and onemorning they banded together to prevent our getting hot water at thegalley. This we could not stand, for the water was bad and only fit todrink when boiled and made into tea or gruel. The captain refused tointerfere, being afraid, we thought, of having trouble with the Kerrymen, and when we told the mate he only swore at our lads for a cowardlylot of sheep-tenders. When dinner-time came, our men got out theircrooks, and, going quietly on deck, formed in a column and, layingabout them right and left, cleared a road to the galley. There werefearful threats made, but nothing came of them, and after that we wererespected and left alone.The ship made little headway owing to the wind keeping in the west,and it was on the eighth day of our voyage that it became known tous that a woman, who had been sick for some time, was ill of thefever. On that day she got delirious and her people could not hide thetruth longer. Four of the oldest men of our party were sent to tellthe captain. He made light of their news and said they were mistakenabout the disease, but he refused to come and see the woman or toerect a partition across the hold to separate us from the rest of thepassengers. We took his treatment sore to heart. When ship-owners gethis passage-money, they don’t care what becomes of the poor emigrant,and would just as soon he would die on the voyage as land him. We wentto sleep that night sad and frightened, for we knew, by reading thepapers, what ship-fever meant. Well, next day the woman was worse, andon the evening of the third she died. We were all anxious that thecorpse should be buried at once, so that the infection might not bespread by it, and two of our folk, taking some things that might beuseful in preparing the body, went over to where it lay to advise thatthat be done. The poor creatures got angry at once, and drove themback, and cursed us for a set of heretics, who would put the decentwoman out of sight without waking her. They laid the corpse on topof some chests in the centre of the ship, surrounded it by candles,and then the keening began, which drove me nearly into hysterics. Thecaptain, hearing what was going on, sent down a keg of rum, and madematters worse. Towards morning, when the drink had taken effect, theybegan to quarrel, and the noise and confusion was terrible. There beingno partition, we could see the whole length of the hold, with the rowsof berths on either side, and towards the far end, in the middle of theship, was the white heap formed by the corpse and lighted by candles,with the women sitting around it, wailing in the most unearthly way,and taking no heed of the men and children who swarmed outside of them,talking, shouting, pushing, and fighting. A candle was knocked downand there was a cry of fire, but an old woman smothered it with hercloak. As we could not sleep, and were afraid they might come to ourend of the ship and give us trouble, we went on deck to wait till allwas over. It was a cold, raw morning, with not enough of wind to keepthe ship from pitching, but anything was better than being below. Whenthe eight o’clock bell struck, the Irish came swarming up, bearing thecorpse. They rested it awhile by the bulwarks, when all, even to thesmallest child, fell on their knees in prayer. Then it was lifted overand let drop into the ocean. The sailors would not help, keeping bythemselves on the forecastle, for they were afraid of the infection.As four days passed without a new case, we were beginning to hope thedanger was passed, but on the fifth three children took ill, and beforethe week was done there were 17 down. After that the disease had itsown way, and deaths became so frequent that it was impossible to holdwakes. We pitied the poor creatures, and gave more than we could spareto help them. The worst want of the sick was water and though it smeltso that a horse would not have touched it and not worth the saving,for there was plenty on board such as it was, the captain would notorder that the allowance be increased, but he encouraged the steward tosell liquor, in the profit of which he shared. I cannot begin to tellyou of the scenes we had to endure; it was of God’s mercy that theydid not take away our senses. If the ship was dirty before the feverbroke out, it was worse now, and the smell, as you stepped from thedeck, was like to knock you down. None of our folk, with one sorrowfulexception, took the disease, which was not considered strange by theIrish, for they accounted the taking away of the sick, especially ofthe young, as a sign of favor by the saints, who carried them to glory.The exception was my husband. When about to raise a tin of tea to hislips one morning, he saw a child looking at him from her berth withsuch entreating eyes, that he went over and held the vessel to thegirl’s mouth. When she was satisfied, he drank what was left. Threedays after he complained of a racking headache, which was followedby a chill, after that the fever set in. Just because he was such alusty man the disease went hard with him, and on the tenth day of hisillness I saw there was no hope. It was in the afternoon as I sat byhim, listening to his ravings, that he suddenly sat up, and pointingto the shaft of sunshine that poured down the hatchway into the darkand loathsome hold, he said, “It fa’s on the Cheviots and glints onthe Tweed e’noo; let me bask in’t once mair.” We carried him over andlaid him in the sunlight. The delirium left him, and a sweet smile cameto his face. “Hae ye onything to say?” I whispered in his ear. “No,Mailie,” he answered softly, “I am quite happy an’ feel the grip o’ mySaviour’s han’: God will be wi’ you and the bairns.” He never openedhis een mair, but the smile lingered on his lips until the sun beganto sink, and as he felt the glow leave his cheek, he muttered, “It’sgrowin’ late and the nicht will be ower cauld for the lammies; I’llca’ the ewes frae the knowes,” and so saying he slipped awa wi’ theGreat Shepherd o’ the Sheep to the lown valley and the still waters.Though my sorrow was like to rive my head, I kept my composure, forthere was work to be done, and nothing can excuse neglect of duty.I prepared him for burial, and when all was ready, an old friend, abrother shepherd of my husband from a boy, gave out the 90th psalm,and when it had been sung, he read the 14th chapter of John, andoffered up a most soul-striving prayer, so that, when the corpse waslifted, there was not a dry cheek. We followed as it was carried tothe deck. The ship was on the banks of Newfoundland, and the ocean wasa dead calm, the new moon lighting up the thin haze of mist that layupon it. I had wrapped my husband in his plaid, and thrust his crooklengthways through the outer fold. Holding each an end of it, two ofthe strongest of our men swung the body well out from the ship’s side.As it disappeared I felt that my love for man as wife had gone with it,and such a sense of desolation came over me as words cannot tell.Five days after we came to quarantine, where the sick were landed, and,just five weeks and two days from the time we left Scotland, we sailedinto Quebec harbor. We were a small and heartbroken handful. Our chestshad been brought on deck and we sat on them, waiting for the steamerto come alongside that was to carry us to Montreal. None of our folkhad asked me what I was going to do, and I knew the reason. It was notthat they were unwilling to help me, but because they had more thanthey could do to mind themselves. They felt for me sore, but they couldnot take the bite out of their own children’s mouths to give to mine.Indeed, there was hardly one of them who knew what they were going todo, for they had come to Canada to seek new homes on chance. I had hadmy own thoughts and had marked out what I would try to do.“There’s the steamer; get yer bairns thegither and I’ll look to yerkists.”It was a hard-favored man that spoke, a shepherd named Braxton fromCumberland, who all the voyage had hardly said a word. Glad of his helpI followed him. He bought milk and bread for us when the steamer calledat Three Rivers, but never saying aught until Montreal was in sight.“What beest thou gaun to do?” he asked. I said I was going to bide inMontreal and try to get something to do. I was strong and had a pair ofgood hands. He gave a kind of snort.“Ye canna mak eneugh to keep five bairns; ye’d better come wi’ me.”“Where till?” I asked.“I dinna knaw yet, but I’se get lan’ somewhere near and ye’se keephouse for me.”“Are ye a single man?” He nodded. I sat thinking. He was a stranger tome beyond what I had seen of him on the ship. Could I trust him? Herewas a home for my children in the meanwhile. For their sake would I doright to refuse the offer? My mind was made up, and I told him I wouldgo with him.“I canna offer thee wages,” he said.“I dinna ask any.”“Very well,” he replied, and no more was said.By this time they had yoked the steamer to a string of oxen, whichhelped it up the current into the harbor, and in course of an hour wewere in Sandy Shaw’s tavern. In answer to Braxton, the landlord toldhim of there being bush land easy to be had near to the city. Next dayat sunrise he left to see it, and it was after dark on the third daywhen he came back. He had got a lot on the Chateaugay, and we were tostart for it early next day. I had the children dressed soon afterdaylight, and the three youngest rode on the French cart that was hiredto take our chests to Lachine. The rest of us followed on foot. It wasa fine morning, but very warm, and the road was deep with dust, whichthe wind raised in clouds like to choke us. When we got to Lachine wewere disappointed to find that the ferryboat was unable to leave herwharf owing to the strong wind blowing down the lake and which hadraised a heavy sea. We sat on our boxes and spent a weary day, my headbeing just like to split with the heat and the shouting and jabberingof the bateau men. There were several hundred emigrants waiting besidesourselves, for the Durham boats could not start until the wind changed.We could not get a bite to buy, for the Canadians were afraid of uson account of the fever, and they had reason, for among those waitingwere many who had been sick of it, and there were some who were sowhite and wasted that you would say the hand of death was upon them.Towards sunset the wind fell and the lake got calmer, so the ferryboat started. Her paddles were not driven by a steam-engine but bya pair of horses, which went round and round. It was going to bemoonlight, so when we were put off at the Basin, we thought we wouldpush on to Reeves’s, for it would be cooler than to walk next day, andwe might thereby catch the canoes Braxton had bespoke. A cart was hiredto convey our chests and the younger children, and we set off. We gotalong very well for about five miles, when we heard distant thunder,and half an hour after the sky was clouded and we saw a storm wouldsoon burst. We knocked at the doors of several houses, but none wouldlet us in. As soon as the habitants saw we were emigrants, they shutthe door in our face, being afraid of the fever. When the rain began tofall, the boy who was driving halted beneath a clump of trees by theriver-side, and I got under the cart with the children. It just pouredfor about half an hour and the lightning and thunder were fearful. Wewere soon wet to the skin, and I felt so desolate and lonesome, that Idrew my shawl over my head, and, hugging my youngest child to my bosom,had a good cry. Those born here cannot understand how castdown andsolitary newcomers feel. For months after I came, the tear would startto my eye whenever I thought of Scotland. Well, the storm passed, andthe moon came out bright in a clear sky. It was much cooler, but theroads were awful, and we went on, slipping at every step or splashingthrough mud-holes. Had I not been so much concerned about the children,I could never have got through that night; helping and cheering themmade me forget my own weariness. It was getting to be daylight when thecart at last stopped in front of a long stone house, in which there wasnot a soul stirring, though the doors were all open. The boy pointed usto where the kitchen was and turned to unyoke his horse. I found fourmen sleeping on the floor, who woke up as we went in. They were Frenchand very civil, giving up the buffaloes they had been sleeping upon forthe children. I sat down on a rocking-chair, and fell at once asleep.The sound of somebody stamping past woke me with a start. It was themaster of the house, a lame man, whom I found out after to be verykeen but honest and kind in his way. It was well on in the day, andbreakfast was on the table. I was so tired and sore that I could hardlymove. Braxton came in and asked if we were able to go on, for thecanoes would be ready to start in an hour. I was determined he shouldnot be hindered by me, so I woke up the children, washed and tidiedthem as I best could, and then we had breakfast, which did us a dealof good. There were two canoes, which were just long flat boats, withtwo men in each to manage them. Our baggage and ourselves were dividedequally between them, and we started, everything looking most freshand beautiful, but the mosquitoes were perfectly awful, the children’sfaces swelling into lumps, and between them and the heat they grewfretful. For a long way after leaving Reeves’s there were breaks inthe bush that lined the river banks--the clearances of settlers withshanties in front--but they grew fewer as we went on, until we would goa long way without seeing anything but the trees, that grew down to thewater’s edge. Getting round the rapids was very tiresome, and it waslate in the day when the men turned the canoes into a creek and pulledup alongside its west bank. This was our lot and where we were to stay.Placing our boxes so as to form a sort of wall, the canoemen felledsome small cedars for a roof, and, lighting a fire, they left us. Iwatched the boats until they were out of sight and the sound of theirpaddles died away, and then felt, for the first time, what it is to bealone in the backwoods. There was so much to do that I had no time tothink of anything, and the children were happy, everything being new tothem. The kettle was put on and tea made, and we had our first meal onour farm--if you had seen it, with the underbrush around us so thickthat we could not go six rods, you would have said it never could bemade a farm.We slept that night under our cover of cedar bushes and slept sound. Inthe morning Braxton and my oldest boy started down the track, for itwas no road, that followed the bank of the Chateaugay, to see if thesettlers below would help to raise a shanty, and while they were goneI did my best to get things into order. For all I had come through,there was lightness in my heart, for there is a freedom and hopefulnessin living in the woods that nothing else seems to give one, and I madechild’s play of discomforts that would have disheartened me had I beentold of them before leaving Scotland. It was nigh noon when Braxtoncame back. He had been made welcome everywhere, all were glad to havea new neighbor, and the promise given that word would be sent to allwithin reach to come to a bee next day. After dinner he took the axeand tried his hand at chopping. He began on a tree about half a footthick and was nicking it all round, we looking on and admiring.“Ye’ll kill somebody with that tree,” said a voice behind us, andturning, to our astonishment we saw a tall woman, in a poke-bonnet,looking on. Explaining that it was necessary to know how a tree wouldfall, she pointed how any direction could be secured by the way it waschopped, and, seizing the axe, she showed how, and, under her strokes,the first tree fell amid the shouts of the children. She was the wifeof our nearest neighbor, and, on hearing of our arrival, had come overto see us, “Being real glad,” as she said, “to have a woman so near.”She stayed an hour, and after finding out all about us, showed me howto do a great many things needful in bush-life. Among the rest, howto make a smudge to protect us from the mosquitoes, which was a realcomfort.Next morning six men came and spent the day in clearing space for theshanty and in making logs for it. The day after, Braxton with two ofthe men went to Todd’s to buy boards and rafted them down the river.On the third day the raising took place, and that night, though it wasnot finished, we slept in it, and proud we were, for the house as wellas the land was our own. It was quite a while before Braxton couldfinish it, for there was more pressing work to do, and for a monthand more our only door was a blanket. The fire was on the hearth withan open chimney made of poles covered with clay. And here I must tellof my first trial at baking. We had brought a bag of flour and, onceestablished in our shanty, I resolved to make a loaf. As you know, inScotland there is no baking of bread in the houses of the commonality,and though nobody could beat me at scones or oat cake, I had never seena loaf made. I thought, however, there was no great knack about it. Iknew hops were needed, and sent one of my boys with a pail to borrowsome from my neighbor, who sent it back half full. I set to work, andafter making a nice dough I mixed the hops with it, and moulded aloaf, which my oldest son, who had seen the process while visitinground, undertook to bake. He put it into a Dutch oven, or chaudron, andheaping hot ashes over it, we waited for an hour, when the chaudron wastaken out and the cover lifted. Instead of a nice, well-raised loaf,there was at the bottom of it a flat black cake. “Maybe it will tastebetter than it looks,” says I, thrusting a knife at it, but the pointwas turned, and we found our loaf to be so hard that you could havebroken it with a hammer. And the taste! It was bitter as gall. Well,that was a good lesson to me, and I was not above asking my neighborsafter that about matters on which I was ignorant.No sooner had shelter been provided for us, than we all turned to withhearty will to clear up a bit of land. My boys were a great help, andthe oldest got to be very handy with the axe, which was well, forBraxton never got into the right hang of using it, and spent doublethe strength in doing the same work my boy did. There is quite an artin chopping. It was exhausting work clearing up the land, being quitenew to us and the weather very hot. Often had Braxton to lay down hisaxe and bathe his head in the creek, but he never stopped, working fromdawn to darkening, and when it was moonlight still longer. I helped tobrush and log, as much to encourage my boys to work as for all I coulddo. When ready to burn, three neighbors came to show us how to do itand, the logs being large and full of sap, it was a slow and laboriousjob. The men looked like Blackamoors, being blacker than any sweeps,from smoke and the coom that rubbed off the logs, while the sweat justrolled down them, owing to the heat of the fires and the weather. Wecame on to our lot on the 29th of May and it was well on in June whenthe remains of the logs were handspiked out of the way and the groundwas kind of clear between the stumps on half an acre. In the ashes weplanted potatoes, and a week after, when a bit more land was taken in,we put in a few more. This done, we turned to make potash. Except alongthe creek there was no timber on our lot fit for making ashes but onits banks there was a fine cut of swale elm. The chopping of the treeswas the easiest part of the work, the getting of the logs together andburning them being difficult, the underbrush being very thick and we soshort of help in handling the felled trees. A neighbor showed us howto make a plan-heap and skid logs, but from inexperience we did notwork to much advantage that summer. We, however, wrought with a willand kept at it, even my youngest, Ailie, helping by fetching water todrink. Young people nowadays have no idea of what work is, and I don’tsuppose that one in twenty of them would go through what their fathersand mothers did. Although it was a dry summer, the banks of the creekwere soft, so our feet were wet all the time and we had to raise theheaps on beds of logs to get them to burn. Our first lot of ashes welost. Before they could be lifted into the leaches, a thunderstorm cameon and in a few minutes the labor of a fortnight was spoiled. Afterthat, we kept them covered with strips of bark.The neighbors were very kind. They had little and had not an hour tospare, but they never grudged lending us a hand or sharing with usanything we could not do without. There was no pride or ceremony then,and neighbors lived as if they were one family. One of them who hada potash kettle lent it to us, and it was fetched on a float or sortof raft, which was pushed up the creek as far as it would go. Thenthe kettle was lifted out and carried by main strength, suspended ona pole. We had thought the chopping, the logging, and the burning badenough, (the carrying of water to the leaches and the boiling of thelye was child’s play) but the melting of the salts was awful. Betweenthe exertion in stirring, the heat of the sun and of the fire, fleshand blood could hardly bear up. How we ever managed I do not know,unless it was by keeping at it and aye at it, but on the first week ofOctober we had filled a barrel with potash, and Reeves took it away inone of his canoes and sold it in town for us, on the understandingthat we were to take the pay out of his store. He made thus both ways,and everything he kept was very dear. I have paid him 25 cents a yardfor common calico and a dollar a pound for tea. We could not helpourselves just then.I should have told you our potatoes grew wonderfully. There is awarmth in newly-burned land or a nourishment in ashes, I don’t knowwhich, that makes everything grow on new land far beyond what they doelsewhere. The frost held off well that fall, and we lifted our cropin good order, except a few that were very late planted, which did notripen properly. When we landed on our lot, Braxton used his last dollarto pay the canoemen, and I had just 15 shillings left after payingthe boards we got at Todd’s mill, so all we had to put us over untilanother crop would be raised, was the potatoes and what we could makeout of potash. We were in no way discouraged. The work was slavish,but we were working for ourselves in making a home; the land was ourown, and every day it was improving. The children took to the countryand its ways at once and were quite contented. We were cheerful andhopeful, feeling we had something to work for and it was worth ourwhile to put up with present hardship. I remember a neighbor’s wife,who was always miscalling Canada and regretting she had come to it,being satisfied with nothing here. She said to her husband one day, inmy hearing, “In Scotland you had your two cows’ grass and besides yourwage sae muckle meal and potatoes, and we were bien and comfortable;but you wad leave, and dae better, and this is your Canada for you!”“Can you no haud your tongue, woman,” he replied, “we hae _a prospect_here, and that is what we hadna in Scotland.” That was just it, we hada prospect before us that cheered us on to thole our hardships.I counted not the least of the drawbacks of the bush, the lack ofpublic ordinances. There was no church to go to on Sabbath, and the daywas spent in idleness, mostly in visiting. Sometimes the young men wentfishing or hunting, but that was not common in our neighborhood, wherethe settlers respected it as a day of rest, though without religiousobservance of any kind. Accustomed from a child to go to kirk regularlyin Scotland, I felt out of my ordinary as each Sabbath came round. Tobe sure, I taught the children their catechism and we read the story ofJoseph and the two books of Kings before the winter set in, but thatdid not satisfy me. The nearest preaching was at South Georgetown,and tho’ I heard no good of the minister I wanted to go. Somehow,something aye came in the way every Sabbath morning I set. At last, itwas after the potatoes had been lifted and the outdoor work about overone Sabbath morning in October, a canoe, on its way down, stopped toleave a message for us. This was my chance, and getting ready I andmy two oldest children went, leaving the others in charge of Braxton,and, for a quiet man, he got on well with children, for he was fondof them. I remember that sail as if it were yesterday--the glow ofthe hazy sunlight, the river smooth as a looking-glass, in which thetrees, new clad in red and yellow claes, keeked at themselves, and thevery spirit of peace seemed to hover in the air. Oh it was soothing,and I thought over all I had come through since I left Scotland. Tho’I could not help thinking how different it had been with me six monthsbefore, yet my heart welled up as I thought of all the blessingsshowered on me and mine and thanked God for his goodness. It was latewhen we came in sight of the church, for the sound of singing told usworship had begun. Dundee was the tune, and as the voices came softlyover the water my heart so melted within me to hear once again and in astrange land the psalmody of Scotland that I had to turn away my headto greet. Stepping ashore where the church stood on the river bank,we went quietly in. It was a bare shed of a place, with planks set upfor seats, and there were not over thirty present. The minister was afresh-colored, presentable enough man, and gave a very good sermon,from the 11th chapter of Second Corinthians. While he was expatiatingon what the apostle had suffered, something seemed to strike him, andhe said, “Aye, aye, Paul, ye went through much but you never cut downtrees in Canada.” He spoke feelingly, for he had to work like the restof his neighbors to earn his bread. One end of the church was boardedoff, and in it he and his wife lived. I will say no more about MrMcWattie, for his failing was notorious. When worship was over, it wasa great treat to mix with the folk. That I did not know a soul presentmade no difference, for all were free then and I made friendships thatday that have lasted to this. When he heard that I was from the southof Scotland, Mr Brodie would take no refusal and I had to go with himacross the river to his house, where we had dinner, and soon after setout to walk home. People now-a-days think it a hardship to walk a mileto church, but I knew many then who went four or five, let the weatherbe what it might. It was dark before we got home, and that night therewas a frost that killed everything. The weather kept fine, however,until December, and we had no severe cold until the week before NewYear.I cannot think of anything out of the common that first winter. Ourneighbors wrought at chopping cordwood to raft to Montreal in thespring, but Braxton could not, for he had no oxen to draw the wood tothe river-bank, so we went on enlarging our clearance. I forgot to say,that one of our North Georgetown acquaintances gave my oldest boy apig in a present, and we managed to keep the little creature alive withthe house-slop and boiling the potatoes that had not ripened well.We all suffered from the cold, which was past anything we had anyconception of before coming to Canada. Our shanty was so open that itdid little more than break the wind, and water spilled on the floor atonce froze. We had plenty of wood, but it was green, and the logs werefizzing and boiling out the sap the day long, and it took Braxton quitea while to learn that some kinds of wood burn better than others. Atfirst he was just as likely to bring in a basswood or elm log as oneof maple or hemlock. Most of the heat went up the big chimney, so thatwhile our faces would be burning, our backs were cold. It was worstin the mornings, for I would rise to find everything solid, even thebread having to be thawed, and the blankets so stiff from our breathsand the snow that had sifted in that I had to hang them near the fireto dry. We kept our health, however, and after the middle of Februarythe weather moderated. In March a deer, while crossing our clearance,broke through the crust, and while floundering in the snow was killedby two of my boys. After that they were on the watch, and ran down andkilled two more with their axes. I salted and dried the hams, and butfor them we would have fared poorly. Having no kettle, we made onlya little maple sugar that spring by boiling the sap in the kailpot.There was no sugar then like what is made now, it was black and had asmoky flavor.The spring was late and wet, which was a great disappointment, forBraxton could not burn the log-heaps he had ready and make potash,on the money for which he counted to buy provisions to put us overuntil harvest. To make matters worse, provisions got to be very scarceand dear, so that flour and oatmeal sold at $5 the quintal, andsometimes was not to be had. One day, when quite out, I went down toRutherford’s, who kept a bit of a store, and he had neither meal norflour, but went into the kitchen and brought out a bowlful of the mealthey had for themselves. I went over the potatoes we had cut for seed,and sliced off enough around the eyes to make a dinner for us. In June,provisions became more plentiful, for the boats had begun to bringsupplies from Upper Canada to Montreal. It was the middle of that monthbefore Braxton had a barrel of potash ready, and the money it broughtdid not pay what we were due the storekeepers. We were kept very barethat summer, but had a prospect before us in the three acres of cropswhich we had got in and which were doing finely.I can never forget that summer from the fright I had about Ailie.She was as sweet a wee dot as there was in the world, so loving andconfiding that she made friends with everybody at sight. I was nevertired of watching her pretty ways and listening to her merry prattle.We were busy one afternoon leaching ashes, when suddenly my oldest boyasked, “Where’s Ailie?” I started, and remembered that it was over anhour since I had seen her. “She’ll have gone back to the house to takea sleep,” I said, and I told one of her sisters to go and see. We wenton again, carrying water, when, after a while, the lassie came backwith the word that she could find Ailie nowhere. We threw down our tubsand dishes, and I shouted her name as loud as I could, thinking shewas nearby in the woods. No answer came. “She’ll have fallen asleepunder some bush, and doesna hear us,” I said, and, with my children,we went here and there searching for her, calling her name, and allwithout finding Ailie. Braxton was an immovable man, who seldom spokeor gave sign of what he was thinking about, but when we were togetheragain and all had the same report, his mouth quivered. Turning downthe wooden scoop with which he had been shovelling ashes, he said,“We’ll dae nae mae wark till we find the bairn.” This time we went moresystematically about our search, but again it was without avail. Itwas a hot afternoon, and the sunshine was so bright it lighted up thedarkest nooks of the forest, but in none we explored was Ailie. When wemet one another in our search and learned not a trace had been found, apang of agony went through our hearts. Braxton followed the creek andlooked well along the bank of the Chateaugay. It was not until it hadbecome too dark to see that our shouts and cries of “Ailie” ceased tosound through the bush. When we had returned to the house, I stirredup the fire and made supper. When we sat down, not one of us couldeat. Braxton bit a piece of bread, but could not swallow it, and witha groan he left the table. We talked over what should be done next,and agreed to warn our neighbors to come and help at daylight, whichBraxton and the boys went to do. None of us liked to speak of what mayhave befallen the child, though we all had our fears, that she hadstrayed down to the Chateaugay and been drowned or gone into the woodsand a wild beast had devoured her. Although they had not troubled us,we knew there were bears and wolves in the swamps to the north of usand there had been even talk of a catamount having been seen. Whilethere was hope I was not going to lose heart, and when I besought theLord to restore my last born to my arms I thanked Him that the nightwas so dry and warm that she could come by no ill from the weather.I did not sleep a wink that night, sitting at the door and strainingmy hearing in the hope that I might catch the cry of my Ailie. Besidethe croaking of the frogs and the bit chirrup of some mother-bird thatwakened in its nest and tucked her young closer under her wings,I heard nothing. When the stars were beginning to fade I set aboutgetting breakfast ready and wakened the children. I had no need tocall Braxton. Poor man, though he said not a word, I knew he had notclosed an eye. I insisted on their making a hearty breakfast so as tobe strong for the work before them, and in the pockets of each I puta slice of bread and a bit of maple sugar for Ailie, should they findher, for I knew she would be perishing from hunger. Soon after sunrisethe neighbors began to drop in until there was a party of over twenty.All had their dogs and some of them had brought axes and guns. It wasarranged we should start out in every direction, yet keeping so nearas to be always within hearing. By spreading out this way in a circlewe would be sure to examine every part of the bush, while two men wereto search the river bank in a canoe. We started, some calling aloud,others blowing horns or ringing ox-bells until the woods echoed again,and all without avail, for no Ailie was to be found. What could havebecome of the bairn? It was as if the earth had opened and swallowedher up. After beating the bush for miles around we gathered togetherat noon, as had been arranged. Not a trace had been found. We talkedit over and over and were at our wits’ end. One lad, new come out andwith his head full about Indians, suggested that one of them might havestolen her, and, indeed, it looked feasible, did we not know that thefew Indians we had were civil and harmless. Had a wild beast taken her,we would have found some fragments of her bit dress. I was dumb withdisappointment and sorrow, and had begun to think I would never see heralive. It was agreed among the men it would be useless to spread outfarther, that we were now deeper in the woods than it was possible forher to have wandered, and that we should use the afternoon in goingback over the ground we had passed, making a better examination of it.We went back slowly, stopping to look at every log and going throughevery hollow, and, though there was once a shout that her trail hadbeen struck, it proved a mistake, and our second scouring of the woodswas as fruitless as the first. The sun was fast westering when we drewnigh our shanty. About four acres back of it there was a waterhole, alow wet spot which all of us had gone round, nobody deeming it possiblefor the child to have put foot upon it. As I looked at the black oozymuck, half floating in water, the thought struck me, the toddler couldwalk where a grown up person would sink, and without saying a wordto the lad who was with me, I drew off my shoes and stockings, and,kilting my petticoat, stepped in. How I wrestled through I do notknow, but once in I had to scramble as I best could until I reached adry spot in the centre that was like an island, and on which therewas a thicket of bushes. Daubed with muck and wringing wet, I pausedwhen I got my footing. I heard a rustle. I was panting for breath, soexhausted that I was about to sit down for a little, but that soundrevived hope in me. I peered through the bushes and saw a deer gazingat me. The creature stared, without moving, which was strange for sotimid an animal. I slipped through an opening in the bushes and there,on a grassy plot, lay my Ailie asleep, crusted with muck, and with herarms clasped round the neck of a baby deer; her wee bit face black withdirt and streaked where the tears had been running down. I snatchedher to my bosom and sinking down I hugged and cried over her like onedemented. Oh, had you heard her joyful cry of “Mammie, mammie!” andseen her lift her bit pinched mou to mine, you would have cried withus. The deer did not stir but stood looking on, startled and wondering,while the fawn lay quietly beside me. This was a mystery, which I soonsolved, for I found the fawn could not move from having a broken leg,and the faithful mother deer would not leave her young one. The shoutthat Ailie had been found soon brought plenty of help, and the firstman that came made to kill the deer, but I prevented him and could not,ever after, bear him near me. There are savages among us who cannotsee any of God’s creatures, however harmless, in a state of nature,without trying to take their lives. Sportsmen, indeed! Useless louts,who would do the country a service were they to use their powder andshot in killing one another. The fallen tree, by which the deer gotacross the swale to its well-hidden nest, was found, and I returned byit, carrying Ailie, while Braxton took the fawn in his arms, the deerfollowing. There was much rejoicing at our humble shanty before ourneighbors left, and many attempts to account for Ailie’s wandering towhere she did. She was weak from want of food and I feared she mightbe the worse of her exposure, but next day, beyond that she was pale,she was well as ever. From what we could gather from her, we made outtolerably plain how her disappearance had come about. While playingnear the house, she saw the deer come out of the woods, jump the fenceof our clearance, and begin to browse on the oats. Ailie seeing thefawn ran to catch the bonnie creature, when the mother took the alarm,and bounded back into the woods. In attempting to follow, the fawnstruck one of its hind feet against the top rail of the fence, andbroke the bone. Ailie caught the wee beastie, and held it in her arms,when the doe returned, bunted her away, and managed to induce its youngone to hirple after it on three legs to its lair in the wee swamp.Ailie, wanting to get the fawn, followed, which she could do, for theymust have gone slowly. When tired of fondling the creature, she wouldhave returned home, but could not find the way out, and cried andslept, and slept and cried, croodling down beside the wounded fawn, asit nestled under its mother, which, from its concern for its injuredoffspring, never tried to drive Ailie away. Well, Braxton set thebroken bone and the leg got strong again, but before it did the fawnhad become so attached to Ailie that it would not leave her, and themother, which had watched over her offspring in the most touching way,had become so accustomed to us and so tame that it did not offer toleave, running in the woods where it had a mind, and making its home ina shed my boys put up for her. She was torn to death, two years after,by a hound that a Yankee neer-do-weel brought in, but the fawn livedwith us until she died of a natural death.We had a fair harvest that fall, and, when it was got in, we had thesatisfaction of knowing that we would have enough to eat until anotherwas ready. There being no oatmeal-mill then in the country, Braxtontraded half of the oats for wheat with a neighbor who wanted them fora lumber-camp. There was a grist mill convenient at the Portage, whichwas burned the following summer, after which we had to send all theway to Huntingdon, where there was a poor sort of a mill. Having nohorse, the bag was carried by Braxton on his shoulder. The want of ayoke of oxen was so much against our getting on, that we determinedto run some risk in getting one, and saved in every way possible withthat in view. The week before New Year we hired a horse and traineaufrom a neighbor, paying him in work, and Braxton went to Montrealwith two barrels of potash. On his way down he had the offer at theBasin of a heifer that was coming in, and instead of buying the clothintended, he saved the money, and took her on his way home. She wasa real beauty, and, out of all the cows we had after, there was notone to me like her, she was so kindly and proved such a grand milker.We were all so proud of her that, for a week after she came, we nevertired looking at her, and the children were comforted for the want ofthe clothing they needed by having her for a pet. You may not think it,but the sorest want of our settlement was clothes. When those broughtfrom the Old Country were done, there was no money to spare to buyothers, and families who had plenty to eat were nigh half-naked, youmay say, and on very cold days could not venture out. I did the best Icould, patching and darning, yet we all suffered much from cold thatwinter on account of want of sufficient clothing. Braxton, poor man,had only a thickness of cloth between him and the weather, yet he nevercomplained and went to his work in the bush on the coldest days. Theexposure, together with hard work, told on him afterwards and shortenedhis life. When the lumber-camps were breaking up, we had a chance of ayoke of oxen within our ability to pay for, and they were brought hometo the barn that had been raised before the snow came. We had not strawenough for three head, but managed to keep them alive by cutting downtrees for them to eat the tender ends of the branches. Many a pailfulof browse I snapped off for my bossie that spring. It was well for usthe grass came early.I do not know that I have much more to tell that would interest you.The oxen gave us a great start in clearing the land, and that season wedid more than all we had done before. We paid the seignior regularly,and once we were a little ahead, it was wonderful how well we got on.Then you must bear in mind, that, as my boys grew up, we were strong inhelp, and our place improved quickly compared with the generality ofthose beside us. That fall we got another cow and two sheep, so that wenever afterwards wanted for milk or yarn. It was a hard struggle, withmany ups and downs, much slavish work and pinching and paring, but incourse of time we had all we could reasonably wish and were content.I was long concerned about the schooling of my children, of whom onlytwo had got any before leaving Scotland. We could not help ourselvesuntil the fourth year of our coming, when a man, lame of a leg, cameround and told us he was a schoolmaster. The neighbors consulted andone of them gave a log stable he was not using, which was fittedup as a schoolhouse, and the man set to work. He could teach hisscholars little, and tried to cover up his deficiencies by threshingthem unmercifully. He was got rid of and another hired, who was morequalified but was given to drink. They were a miserable lot of teachersin those days, being either lazy or drunken fellows who took to keepingschool without considering whether they were qualified. In course oftime we had a church at Ormstown, Mr Colquhoun, a proud Highlander,being the first minister. When we came, there was only one (old Jones)living where Ormstown stands, now it is a large village, with buildingsthe like of which nobody could have expected to see. There has beena wonderful improvement all over, and, when I first saw it, to haveforetold the country would become what it now is, nobody would havebelieved. That the people have improved correspondingly I do not think.The money, scraped together by the hard work of their fathers, I haveseen squandered by lads who despised the plow, and the upsetting waysof many families are pitiful to see. Folk in the old times lived farmore simply and happily.You want to know what became of Braxton. He died 14 years after wecame here. It was in the winter and I thought he had caught cold whileskidding logs in the bush. Any way, inflammation set in, and he diedwithin a week of his first complaining. We mourned sorely for him. Amore patient or truer soul never breathed, and to the example he setmy boys, who have all done well, I set down much of the credit. Wecounted up his share of the property, and, adding £20 to it, sent itto his sister in England, who was his only relative. I may say all myold acquaintances are gone, for there are few now on the river who werethere when I came, and I wait patiently to follow them, living happily,as you see, with Ailie and her children until the Lord is pleased tocall me.JEANIE MORISON.CHAPTER I.Only those who have lived in a cold country like Canada can fullyrealize the pleasurable sensations which attend the opening of spring.The weary monotony of winter, with its unvarying aspect of whitefields, and steady frost, often so intense as to make exposure painful,gives way to freedom and life, and with some such feelings as stir theheart of the prisoner, when he exchanges his darksome cell for sunshineand green fields, does the dweller of Canada hail the time when thesnowbanks disappear and when he can, without wraps, move whether hewill in the genial atmosphere. It was at that period of the year whenthe simple incidents I am going to relate took place.Amid the unbroken forest which covered the county of Huntingdon inthe year 1820, a log shanty stood on the west bank of Oak creek, at apoint where the beavers had by their industry formed a small meadow.The shanty was rude as might be, of unsquared logs, with a roof ofbasswood split into slabs, and a stick chimney. The interior consistedof a single room, and a small one at that. The inmates were a motherand daughter. The mother, engaged in spinning, sat in the sunshinewhich streamed through the open door, brightening the few pieces offurniture it fell upon and whitening still more the heaps of ashes inthe open fire-place, behind which smouldered a huge backlog. She hadevidently passed her fiftieth year, while the pressed lips and look ofpatient reserve told of the endurance of a lifelong sorrow.“Dae ye no see or hear ocht?” she asked, looking through the doorway tothe woods beyond, to which she often turned her eyes.“No, mother,” replied the girl addressed, who was sitting on thedoorstep.“What can hae come ower him!” said the woman in a low voice.“Dinna fret; he’ll be here soon,” said Jeanie in a tone that spoke moreof a desire to comfort her mother than faith in her statement.As if not heeding her, the mother resumed, “He said he would be backlast nicht, and he should hae been. I sair misdoot ill has befaen him.”It was of her husband of whom she spoke. He had worked all winter for aparty of Americans, who were cutting the best of the timber along thebanks of the creek, and had gone Monday morning to aid them in drivingthe logs to the point on the Chateaugay where they were to be formedinto rafts and thence taken to Quebec. His last words had been that hewould, at the latest, be back the following evening and it was now thethird day.Jeanie strained her eyes and ears to catch the faintest sign of herfather’s approach. The quaver of the grey-bird and the chirrup of thechipmunk came occasionally from the recesses of the woods, which laysleeping in the April sunshine that glorified everything, but no rustleof branch or cracking of dried stick that would indicate an approachingfootstep. The usually silent creek, now swollen by melted snow, lappedits banks in pursuing its tortuous course, murmuring a soothing lullabyto the genial day; and that great peace, to be found only in mountainrecess or forest depth, brooded over the scene. But there, where allthe influences of nature were so soothing, were two hearts filled withanxious care.“Jeanie,” suddenly exclaimed the mother, after a long pause, andstaying the whirr of the wheel, “you maun gang and seek your father.Gae down to Palmer’s and there you’ll find the rafts, and the men willtell you whether he left for hame or no.”“But I dinna like to leave you, mother, and I am sure you are takingtrouble without need. He will be here by dark.”The mother understood the affectionate motive of her child in trying tomake light of her fears, but well knew her anxiety was no less than herown.“Say nae mair, my lassie, but gang while there is time for you to getback. You ken the yarn for the Yankee wife at the Fort is ready andthere is no flour until he gangs there for it.”Casting one long eager glance down the creek, along which her fathershould come, the girl turned in from the door and made ready for thejourney. Her preparations were easily made. The slipping on of herstoutest pair of shoes and throwing a plaid over her arm, as a hap fromthe cold after sunset, comprised them, and bidding her mother not tofret for she would bring back good news she started. She did not followthe creek, but struck northward across the peninsula that forms thetownship of Elgin, her design being to reach Trout river, as being morefordable than the wider Chateaugay. The path was, probably, at firsta deer run, which the few who travelled it, chiefly lumbermen, hadroughly brushed. Only one accustomed to the woods could have kept thetrack, for, to a stranger’s eye, it differed little from the openingswhich ever and anon appeared among the trees. Jeanie, however, was nonovice to the path or to the bush, and she stepped quickly and withconfidence on her way. She had walked about an hour beneath the solemngloom of the primeval forest when she saw an opening ahead, and knewshe was approaching Trout river. On reaching it, she followed its bank,until, with one end grounded in a little bay, she found a large log.Grasping the first straight stick she saw lying about to serve as apole, she pushed the log from its anchorage, and stepping on it as itmoved guided it across the narrow river. From the liability of the logto roll, such a mode of ferrying is dangerous to those unused to it,but Jeanie knew how to place her feet and keep her balance and speedilygained the other bank and resumed her journey. On reaching the placewhere the two rivers unite, she could not, despite her anxiety, helppausing to admire the beautiful expanse of water, which, unruffled by abreath of wind, lay glassing itself in the sunshine, while the forest,which rose from its margin on either side, formed no unfit setting.Presently she saw a ripple upon its surface, and her keen eye perceivedthe black head of a muskrat, which was making its way to the oppositebank. While she followed the rapid movements of the little creature,there was the flash and smoke of a gun before her, and, while the woodswere still echoing the report, a dog jumped into the water to bringin the rat, which floated dead upon the current. A few steps broughtJeanie to the marksman, a tall, wiry man, of rather prepossessingappearance. His dog had returned and laid the rat at his master’s feet,who was encouraging him with exclamations of “Good dog! good dog!”when he caught sight of her.“Waal neow, who would a thought it? Miss Jeanie herself and nobodyelse. How do you do?” And stretching forth his sinewy arm, he graspedher hand in a clutch that would have made a bear shed tears.“Oh, I’m well, thank you, Mr Palmer, and my mother, but we’re in soretrouble.”“Don’t say the old man is sick?” and an anxious look passed over thekindly face of the honest Yankee.“Oh, dear sir, we dinna ken whether he’s sick or well. He left homeMonday morning and was to be back next night and he hasna come yet, andI’ve come to ask after him and get help to find him if nobody knowswhere he is?” As she spoke there was a tremor in Jeanie’s voice, and atear glistened on her drooping eyelashes.“Ha, do tell; this is serious,” and the hunter leant upon his rifleand gazed abstractedly upon the river, as if trying to conjecture whatcould have become of the lost man, until, noting Jeanie’s evidentdistress, he aroused himself, and, exhorting her to keep up heart, ledthe way to his house.“You see,” he said, as they picked their way along the rough path bythe river’s edge, “there ain’t much to shoot yet and what there isain’t worth killing, but I kinder felt lonesome to be about doors sofine a day, and I took a stroll, tho’ all I came across was thatmushrat, which, darn it skin, ain’t worth the lead that killed it.”“If the shooting is poor, the fishing will be good,” said Jeanie, whohumored the spirit of the sportsman.“Couldn’t be better,” answered Mr Palmer, “I speared seven salmon atthe foot of the rapids last night, and this morning I drew my seinefull of as pretty fish as you would want to clap your eyes on.”The sound of rushing water told of their approach to the rapids, at thehead of which, on a knoll a few rods to the left, stood Mr Palmer’shouse, which was a comfortable log one, overshadowed by majestic pines.On entering, they found Mrs Palmer, a rather delicate-looking woman,engaged in baking. Uttering an exclamation of surprise at the sightof Jeanie, she wiped her dusty hands and gave her a cordial welcome,as well she might, for the visits she had received from members ofher own sex, since she had taken up her abode by the Chateaugay,might have been counted on her fingers without exhausting them. Onlearning the cause of Jeanie’s journey, she received the tidings withthe same anxious look as her husband. Evidently both entertained theworst forebodings, while both had a delicacy in speaking of what theybelieved to be the cause of his absence. Neither had seen him, butthe gang of lumbermen he had helped were now forming a raft half amile below the house and it was arranged that Mr Palmer should go andsee them while Jeanie would wait. Her hostess resumed her baking, andJeanie, feeling the heat indoors oppressive on so fine a day, steppedout and sat on a log, near enough to keep up the conversation yetsufficiently far to enjoy the balmy atmosphere and the beauty of thescene before her. And here, before attempting to describe it, let metell what manner of woman Jeanie was. She had that first quality ofa handsome girl, stature--she was tall, with a form instinct withlife--lithe and graceful, which, when matured by age, would becomedignified also. She had no pretension to beauty, beyond what theliveliness of youth and a sweet temper can give to the countenance, butstill her well-formed mouth, gray eyes, a forehead broad though nottoo high, and a wealth of light brown hair went to form a face thatwas pleasant to look upon. She had been a visitor at Palmer’s housebefore, but its surroundings were still sufficiently novel to engageher even in her present distracted frame of mind, for, as became aScotchwoman, she had a keen relish for whatever is beautiful in nature.Above, and until directly opposite her, the Chateaugay came sweeping,with graceful curve, a wide, unruffled sheet of water, until suddenlyit fell over a rocky ledge and became a mass of foaming rapids, whichbrattled between banks, covered by trees and overhung by hazel bushes,until lost to sight by a sharp bend a considerable distance below.[A]Being at flood height, the rapids were seen at their best, and Jeanienever wearied admiring the graceful sweep of the smooth water as itneared the ledge that preceded its fall, or the tumult of breakers intowhich, a moment after, it was tossed. It flashed upon her that theriver was, perhaps, to prove a true type of her own and her mother’sfate,--the even tenor of their life hitherto was about to be suddenlybroken by her father’s disappearance, and then the water, tossed fromrock to rock, broken into spray and driven in every direction, exceptupward, would too truly represent their life hereafter. Raising hergaze to the south, she caught a glimpse, through a gash among the treeson the opposite bank where fire had levelled them, of a range of smoothmoulded hills, which, blue and soft in the sweet spring sunshine,brought back to memory the dear old hills of her native land, and joymingled with her sorrow.The afternoon wore away apace and still Mr Palmer did not return. Abovethe noise of the rapids Jeanie heard, now and then, the shouts of thelumbermen as they heaved the logs in forming their raft, and whom MrPalmer had gone down to see. Having finished her household duties andspread the supper on the table, Mrs Palmer sat down beside Jeanie and,with kindly craft, by talking of commonplace matters, strove to diverther mind. By-and-by the appearance of a fine spaniel, the same that hadswam to the rat, indicated the approach of Mr Palmer, who, when he cameup to them, leading his eldest girl, a chattering child, seemed in nohurry to answer the questioning eyes of the two women.“Blessed if the dog don’t scent something,” said the worthy man, as hewatched the animal creeping to a clump of underbrush to the right.“Bother the dog,” exclaimed Mrs Palmer, “what did the men tell you?”“Waal, they ain’t jest sure, you know, but they guess ’tis all right,”and as he drawled out the words slowly and reluctantly, Jeanie couldsee that he was far from thinking it was all right.“Oh, sir,” she said, “you are a father yourself and you are as dear toyour child as she is to you. Tell me the worst, and be done wi’ it.”“Don’t take on, Jeanie; it may be all right yet. Your father helpedto tote the logs to the foot of the rapids, and left them, well andstrong, to walk home last night. I rather conjecture he lost his way,but he will be home by this time.”This was all Mr Palmer seemed disposed to tell, and, hoping for thebest, she tried to share in her host’s affected confidence as to herfather’s safety, and followed him in answer to his wife’s call “Thatsupper was ready.” A capital cook, and having a larder to draw fromreplenished by the gun and rod of her husband, Mrs Palmer, in honor ofher guest, had spread a table that contrasted painfully with the meagrefare to which Jeanie was accustomed, and made her think of the mess ofboiled corn of which her mother would then be partaking. After supper,the canoe was launched, and bidding farewell to her hostess and herlittle girl on the river’s bank, Jeanie stepped in, when, propelled bythe paddle of Mr Palmer, it began steadily to stem the current.Who that has undergone the agony of sorrowful apprehension has notnoted how every trifling incident that may have occurred during thatperiod has become imprinted indelibly upon the memory? The watcherby the sick-bed, over which death hovers, is puzzled how, at a timewhen the mind is absorbed with one thought, the perceptions should beso sharpened as to note trivial events and objects, down to the veryfurniture and pattern of the wallpaper, which on ordinary occasionsleave no trace upon the memory. On that April evening Jeanie’s mindwas laboring under this intensified acuteness, and while broodingcontinually over her father’s probable fate, to her dying day sheremembered every feature of the scenery she was now passing. The smoothflowing river, swollen and discolored by the melted snow from thehills, hemmed in on either bank by a thick growth of trees, many ofwhich, as if enamored with the beautiful sheet of water by which theygrew, bent over it until, in their leafy prime, their branches almostkissed its surface. Now, though leafless, their tops were glorified bythe setting sun, which filled the still air with the lambent blue hazewhich distinguishes the evenings of early spring in Canada. Keeping tothe Chateaugay at its union with Trout river, the canoe stole silentlybeneath the shadow of the overhanging trees until the mouth of Oakcreek was reached, when Jeanie stepped ashore to pursue her way on footto her home. Before bidding her goodbye, Mr Palmer paused and said:“Now, you keep up a good heart for whatever may happen, and we’ll be uptomorrow to search the woods. Give that to your mother and--God blessyou.” Without giving her time to say a word, he pushed his canoe intothe stream and speedily glided out of sight, leaving Jeanie standing onthe bank perplexed by what he had said and holding the basket he hadthrust into her hands, which contained a loaf of bread and a stringof fish. With a heavier heart than ever, she began to trace her wayhomeward by the creek. Once in that lonely journey she thought she sawher father walking ahead of her, and once she thought she heard hisvoice. She called out and paused to listen for a reply. The only soundthat reached her was the dismal croakings of the frogs. Knowing thather imagination was deceiving her, she hurried on and, when she caughtthe first glimpse of light gleaming from her humble home, it outlinedher mother’s figure seated on the doorstep waiting her return.“You hav’na found him, Jeanie?”“No, mother; and he hasna come hame?”“What can hae come ower him!” exclaimed the mother, as she sank into aseat by the open fire-place.It was remarkable that in their conversation no conjecture was hazardedby either as to the probable fate of the missing one. Both, plainly,entertained the same painful surmise, which they were alike ashamed tobreathe. They sat by the glowing backlog for many hours, hoping againsthope that the wanderer might return, until Jeanie overcome by fatiguesought her bed. Once she awoke during the night, thinking she heard avoice. She listened in the darkness. It was her mother wrestling withGod on behalf of her father.FOOTNOTE:[A] These rapids were known to old settlers as “Palmer’s rapids.” Thequarrying of them for building purposes has greatly changed theirappearance.CHAPTER II.Early next day Jeanie and her mother saw a short, stout man emerge fromthe woods. He was a stranger to them, but his aspect indicated he was alumberman. He had a towsy head of reddish hair and a matted beard andwhiskers of the same hue.“A pleasant day, ma’am,” he said, in a voice so soft and insinuating,and contrasting so strikingly with the roughness of his appearance,that Mrs Morison was somewhat startled. “It is, indeed, a fine springday,” she replied.“And the water is high, ma’am, and the rafts are getting awayfinely--oh, very finely,” and the man stood complacently eyeing themother and daughter, and rubbing his hands.“Hae ye seen ocht o’ my husband? Ye’ll hae come about him?”“Oh, my dear ma’am, don’t fret; take it coolly and comfortable like.”“I see ye ken aboot him; oh, dinna play wi’ me, but tell me at once.”Not in the least discomposed, the little man, in more oily tones thanever, replied, “Well, well, ma’am, there is no denying it, accidentswill happen, you know. You shouldn’t be supposing the worst, and takingit easy, for”--Before he could finish his sentence there was heard a heavy tramplingin the woods, and soon there came from beneath their cover half a dozenmen, four of them carrying a burden laid on two poles. They came insilence to the door, when Mrs Morison saw their burden was her husband.She snatched away the red handkerchief that covered his face, a glanceat which showed her he was dead. She gave a shriek that resoundedthrough the forest, and fell senseless upon the corpse.The career of the dead man may be told in a few words. He had been theson of a small farmer in the south of Scotland, a strapping, livelyfellow, who won the good graces of the daughter of a draper in theneighboring village. Her parents opposed her keeping company with him,not merely because his circumstances were indifferent but becausehis habits were not of the steadiest, he being fond of convivialgatherings, at which, more than once, he had got overcome by drink.Their opposition seemed only to strengthen their daughter’s affectionfor the free-hearted, good tempered young fellow, and the upshotwas, that one morning she was not to be found, and before eveningthey learned she had been married. The imprudent match resulted asthe parents had anticipated; the young man was unequal to the taskof supporting a wife and his habits did not mend. Moving to a miningvillage, he got work as a laborer, and out of his scanty earnings alarge percentage went into the till of the whisky shop every Saturdaynight, so that his wife, to eke out a living, had to exert herself todo something also. Quietly and uncomplainingly she took in sewing,washed, or spun, as opportunity offered, to earn an honest shilling,and did what lay in her power to keep things decent. Children came butnone lived to maturity save Jeanie. The village was unhealthy, itsfumes and murky smoke were not favorable to childhood, typhus was aregular winter visitor, and, more than all, the narrow means at herdisposal afforded not the necessaries of life in the abundance childrenneed, so, to her heart-sorrow, one after another was taken away. Timepassed, and her father died, leaving her a small legacy, and withthis she determined they should emigrate. She fondly thought were herhusband removed from his boon companions, were all his old associationsbroken, and he transplanted into a new sphere, he might reform. Oftenhad she striven with him, often had hope kindled in her bosom thathe was going to keep the good resolutions he so often formed; alwaysdoomed to bitter disappointment. To emigrate was the last chance, itseemed to her, and for Canada they accordingly sailed. Deplorable torelate, on the day of their arrival at Quebec her husband got drunkwith several of his fellow-passengers who went to take, as they termedit, a parting glass, and before he got over his spree the greater partof their little stock of money was gone. Instead, therefore, of beingin a position to go to Upper Canada and take up land, as intended, hehad to engage at Quebec with a lumberman who was getting out mastsand square timber on the Chateaugay, and thus it came that, two yearsbefore the opening of our narrative, he had made a home, a poor oneas we have seen, in what is now the township of Elgin. Altho theirprivations were great, Mrs Morison did not regret the change fromthe dirty, squalid, mining village in Scotland to the lonely woodsof Canada. Her husband had fewer opportunities of getting drink and,on the whole, they lived happily. Possessing a superior educationherself and having moved before her marriage in respectable society,she brought up her daughter very differently from what might have beenexpected from their circumstances, and Jeanie, despite her home-spundress, had acquirements and manners that qualified her to move in anystation of life. As already stated, on the Monday morning Morison hadgone to assist in running logs out of the creek. On the evening of thesucceeding day his employer settled with him for the season’s work,and, in addition to the small balance of wages that was coming to him,gave him a few pieces of pork to take home and, fatal parting gift, abottle of rum. He left the raftsmen in high spirits, an able-bodied ifnot very active man, taking the track that led to his humble dwelling.What followed no human eye witnessed. He never reached his home, andthe searching-party that morning had discovered his body a few yardsfrom the creek, stretched upon the ground, with his face immersed in apool of water--a pool only an inch or so in depth, left by the meltingof the snow and gathered in a cavity formed by the roots of a tree. Hadhe, when he stumbled and fell, moved his head ever so little, he wouldhave breathed and lived. The more than half empty bottle, found in hisstony grasp, showed he had been too overcome to stir a hairsbreadth,and there, in a basin of water, so small that a squirrel could haveleaped it; so shallow that a robin, in pruning his wings, could havestepped through without wetting a feather; this stalwart man, beforewhose axe the loftiest pines had fallen and whose vigorous oar hadstemmed the rapids of the Chateaugay, had ignominiously met his death,within hail of the faithful wife and loving daughter who were anxiouslywaiting his return. Jeanie, in going home the preceding evening,had unconsciously passed within a few paces of the body which oncecontained her father’s spirit. On finding it, damp from the exposureof a day and two nights, the searching party had made the body aspresentable as possible, and sent ahead one of their number to break,as gently as might be, the news to the wife and daughter. With whatsuccess he, who was chosen on account of his smooth tongue, acquittedhimself, the reader knows.So long did Mrs Morison remain in her swoon that once the dreadfulthought darted through Jeanie’s mind that she was not going to recover,and at one fell swoop she was to be deprived of both parents. She didnot cease her exertions, however, and while bathing the rigid templesshe rejoiced to see the flush of returning animation. Slowly did MrsMorison raise herself to a sitting posture, and looked in a dazedmanner, as if wondering why they were there, at the rough lumbermengrouped around her, who stood in silence and with the awkwardness ofpeople who were anxious to help but did not know how. Unconsciouslyshe moved her glance from one to the other until it fell upon thebody of her husband. Recollection returned in a flash, and drawingthe inanimate form to her lap she pressed the bloated and discoloredfeatures to her lips.“Oh, Willie,” she exclaimed, unconscious in her overwhelming passion ofsorrow that there was a listening ear, “lang did we ken ane anither andbraw and gallant were you ance; my pride and joy. Sair hae oor trialsbeen and muckle hae ye been misguided, but aye faithfu and true to me.Oh, that I had been wi’ you; oh, that ye had given me your last kissand deed in my arms! There hae been them wha despised you, wha tauld meto leave you; little did they ken o’ the love that bound me to you. Oh,that we should hae partit thus!”Here she paused, and turning her eyes upwards she slowly and reverentlysaid: “Merciful God, as in your wise decree you have been pleased tobring this affliction upon me, grant, in your pity, that I tarry notlong behind him whom ye hae taen awa.”The solemn petition calmed the tumult of her mind, and reverentlydisposing of the body, she rose to her feet and said modestly--“You will excuse me, freens, for taking on sae sairly afore you, but Icouldna help it; this misfortune has come so sudden. I thank you forwhat you hae dune, and, gin it be your pleasure, as you can do nae mairnoo, leave us alane and come the morn to bury him wha’s gane.”The red-whiskered man was about to make a voluble reply, when he wascut short by a tall lumberman, in whose eye there glistened a tear,with the remark, “Yes, ma’am, we are at your service and mean to do allwe can for you.” Then, looking at his comrades, he said, “Let us go,”and turning abruptly he led the way, leaving the mother and daughteralone with their dead.CHAPTER III.It is true in the moral world as in the material that after a stormcomes a calm. The agony of suspense, the wild burst of passionatesorrow had swept over them, and the morning succeeding the saddiscovery found mother and daughter composed and resigned. The worstwas now known, a worst there was no remedying, and so they bowed,without needless fret or repining, beneath the trial. The sun had risenin an unclouded sky and his beams were warmer than on the precedingdays, and as they came pouring down unstintingly on the turbid watersof the creek and the uplifted branches of the forest, it seemed as ifsummer was nigh and buds and leaves and green sward would speedilysucceed the birds whose noisy concert ushered in the rosy dawn.Everything had been arranged in the humble shanty with all the deftnessof order-loving hands; on one side of it, beneath a white cloth, wasthe corpse. Mrs Morison was seated on the chair at the window; Jeaniesat at her feet on the doorstep.“Wasna father a braw man when you first foregathered?”“He was the handsomest lad in the countryside; a very pleasure for theee to rest on. Little dae they ken what he was like that didna seehim then, and a kinder or truer heart couldna be. O, Jeanie, I justworshipped him when we were lad and lass.”“But your father didna like him?”“Dinna put it that way, Jeanie. He liked him but he saw a faut in himthat spoiled a’. I was wilfu. I said Willie would gie up the company hekeepit when he was merrit, and that it was guid-fellowship and no loveo’ the drink that enticed him. I dinna say that I regret what I did,or that my lot hasna been as guid as I deserved--God forgive me that Ishould repine or say an unkindly word o’ him that lies there--but youngfolks dinna lippen to their parents in choosing partners as they ocht.”“Hoots, mother; when a lad or lass hae found their heart’s love, whatfor suld father or mother interfere?”“Easy said, Jeanie, but think ye there is ony body in the wide worldloes son or dochter as a parent does? They are as the apple o’ theiree, and his or her happiness is all they seek. Dootless there arewarld’s worms o’ parents who only look to the suitor’s gear and wadbreak off the truest love-match that ever was gin he were puir. I dinnaspeak o’ them, for they are out o’ the question. But take parents byordinar, who only seek their bairns’ welfare, and the son or dochterwha disregards their advice in choosing a life-mate will hae mickle torepent o’.”“I dinna see hoo that is,” said Jeanie, “for surely their marriageconcerns only themselves?”“True in a sense, Jeanie, that as we mak oor bed we maun lie on’t.Think ye, though, o’ a parent’s experience, that nae glamor o’ loveblinds their ee, that their haill concern is for their bairn’shappiness, and they may see fauts in the would-be partner o’ theirchild that can only result in meesery. Young folks shouldna thinktheir parents are obstinate or stupid when they oppose their marryingthis ane or that ane. In maist cases they hae solid reason for theiropposition, and the son is foolish that winna get his parents consentbefore he gangs too far and the dochter silly indeed who says Yeswithout taking counsel o’ her mother.”“Oh, but that wadna dae always,” replied Jeanie, deprecatingly, in atone as if such a course would rob love of its romance.“Come, noo, Jeanie, tell me what better adviser can a dochter hae thanher mother, and hasna the father a richt to hae some say in a matchseeing that, if it disna turn out weel, he may hae a useless son-in-lawto sorn on him or, in his auld days, hae his dochter or a tawpy of ason’s wife come wi’ a wheen bairns to seek shelter in his hame? Na,na, the first commandment wi’ promise requires obedience in this asin ither callings o’ life, and happy is the wedding whaur the truelove o’ the young couple is crooned wi’ the blessings (given without amisgiving) o’ their parents, for there is, then, a reasonable prospectthat the match will prove what a’ should be--a heaven upon earth.”“Mightna the parents be mistaen, mother?”“Aye, and so might the lad or lass, and far mair likely that the youngshould err than the auld. Had I taen the advice my father and motherpressed on me, advice that came frae their lifelong experience andtheir affection for me, it wad hae been different--no that I regretwhat has happened for mysel but for you, Jeanie, that maun grow up inthis wilderness, and for your brithers and sisters wha hae gane to abetter land.” And here, as the remembrance of the years of poverty andof wretchedness caused by her husband’s intemperate habits flashed uponher, she burst into tears.“Oh, mother,” exclaimed Jeanie, as rising and standing beside her sheclasped her bowed head to her bosom, “dinna tak on so. I wadna hae hadit otherwise, and wad suner hae bided wi’ you than had the queen on thethrone for my mother. We hae been very happy for a’ that has come andgone, and sae will we yet. Were it to part us, I wadna marry the bestman in a’ Canada; I will aye be wi’ you and will aye be obedient toyour will.”“I ken that, my bairn, but,” said the mother, raising her tear-stainedface, “promise me this--and it is a promise that him wha lies there wadhae backed, for weel he kent his ain faut--that, nae matter hoo ye maybe drawn to him, you will never marry a man that likes his glass.”“I promise,” said Jeanie with simple solemnity, and drawing up hergraceful figure to its full height, she, as if anxious to break off thesubject, turned to get a wet towel, with which she wiped her mother’sface, “for,” as she remarked, “ye maun be decent when the folk come.”It was nigh noon before any of the visitors made their appearance. Inthe then unsettled state of the country news spread slowly even whenmessengers were sent out expressly to carry it. Everybody came thatheard of the melancholy occurrence, for in those primitive days, whenonly the young and healthy inhabited this section of country, deathswere so rare that a funeral was regarded as an important event whichnobody missed. Straggling in from different points they came in twosand threes, except the lumbering-party with whom the deceased had beenconnected, who appeared in a body marching up the creek, carrying thecoffin--a rude box of unplaned boards--with Mr Palmer leading. Twofeatures in the assemblage were noticeable, one being that hardly a manamong them had a coat, the other the fewness of the women. The men,great brawny fellows in home-made shirts and pants fastened by belts,gathered in clusters in the clearing to exchange news and talk over thecircumstances attending the event that had brought them together, whilethe women went into the house. The sun was sinking fast towards thewest before the preparations necessary for the burial were completed.When the word went round that the grave was ready, one by one theyfyled into the house to take a last look of the face of their lateneighbor, after which the lid of the coffin was nailed down. There wasno clergyman to be had at the time and among those present there was noone inclined, even if capable, to conduct religious services. If thesolemn observances of such occasions were absent, those present had notcome unprepared to maintain a custom which in those days was universalin Canada, and, for all the writer knows, may still be in the MotherCountry--that of passing a glass of liquor before lifting the coffin.A man, with a jar in one hand and a tin cup in the other, went roundthe company, tendering the filled cup to each, which it would have beenbad manners to refuse and which nearly all emptied before returning.When all out of doors had been helped, the man, a well-meaning, kindlyfellow, stepped into the shanty to regale those inside. Thinkingit good manners, he pressed to where Mrs Morison was sitting and,deliberately filling the cup to the brim, tendered it to her first.Mrs Morison gave him a piercing look. “What!” she exclaimed in a lowvoice, so emphasized by deep feeling that every word sunk into theminds of those present; “What! Do you ask me to take that which hasmurdered my husband?”“Take a taste, ma’am,” said the red-whiskered man, who was in the room,“it will do you good.”“Do me good!” she re-echoed, “then it will be for the first time in mylife. That do me good that took away the bread for lack of which mybairns, noo saints in glory, perished! That do me good that robbed myhusband of his usefulness and good name; that made him fit for onlyorra jobs and to be despised as a drunkard! That do me good the love ofwhich supplanted his love for me, for it was the stronger o’ the twa orwad he no hae left it alane for my sake? That do me good that filledhis bosom with remorse, which hurt his health, and, last of all, hastaen his life! Oh, that it hasna caused the loss of his soul; that,in the moment of his passing breath, he found time to seek acceptancewith God for the Redeemer’s sake! Take it away,” she screamed with theenergy of one who shrinks at the sight of a snake, “take it away, andmay the curse of the widow and the orphan rest upon them that make andsell it--wha tempt decent men to destruction in order that they mayhave an easy living.”Abashed at so unexpected a reception, the man continued to standstupidly before her, holding the cup and jar. Seeing his puzzled look,Mrs Morison, who had recovered her composure, quietly said, “I kenyou mean it kindly, and sae far I thank you, but gin you think o’ it,you will see that the bottle may be your own worst enemy and they aresafest and happiest who leave it alane. As a favor, freen, I ask you noto offer it in this house.”A few minutes afterwards the coffin was borne out of doors, when fourlumberers lifted it on their shoulders, and, leading the stragglingprocession, walked to the grave, which had been dug on a knoll close tothe creek, the only spot that could be found convenient sufficientlyfree of trees and their roots. When the coffin was lowered, each manlifted his hat for a moment, there was a pause, and then the grave wasfilled in.With thoughtful kindness those who came had brought some gift of foodto replenish the widow’s larder, and now, while all the rest departed,the lumbermen remained, until sunset, chopping firewood and puttingthe house and its surroundings to rights, so that, before they lay downto sleep that night, Mrs Morison and Jeanie included in their prayerthanks to God for having so bountifully provided for them.LOST IN THE WOODS.You have heard of my passing a night in the bush, and want me to tellyou about it. When we came to Hinchinbrook, which was in July, 1831,the shanty my husband put up did not stand where this house is, buton a ridge at the end of the lot. For the first two years we had noneighbor nearer than half a mile, for though the lots on each side ofus were granted, nobody was then living upon them. From morning to darkI saw nothing but the bush that encircled our house and the littleclearance of blackened stumps. Oh, but it was lonely! It was worse thana jail, for the prisoner gets a blink out of his cell window of thewide prospect without, and of houses and people, but I saw nothing forseveral years but trees, and trees, until our clearance so extendedthat it met that on the east side of our lot, and all at once we, onefine day, came in sight of a neighbor’s house. The second Spring wewere on the lot, my husband left to help to take a raft down to theBasin, leaving me alone with Henry, who was then the baby. He expectedto be back in four days, or by the end of the week at furthest. If ithad not been that I had so much work to do I would have cried my eyesout, it was so miserable to be left alone in the woods, and William hadnever been away so long before. The four days passed and Sabbath came,but he did not. I got very anxious, and all day could scarcely keep myeyes off the spot at which he would come out of the bush, and where thetrack from the river crossed our lot, and at night I could not sleepa wink, thinking every moment I heard his footstep. Once I was sure Iheard him moving outside. I got up and opened the door and called hisname. There was no answer, and it was so dark I could not see a rodoff. Lighting a bit of pitch pine at the fire, I held it up to lookagain, when there was a patter of feet and something bounded by me. Itwas sugar-time and there were a few trees tapped around the house. Thenoise I heard was a few deer drinking the sap out of the troughs. Iknew not what to do. I wanted to go in search of William, but how couldI leave our small stock? They might starve before I got back, and thatwould ruin us. It happened Monday afternoon, just when I had determinedto go over to the nearest neighbor and see if I could get some one togo and enquire for my husband, though I knew it would be useless, forevery man and boy old enough had gone with the rafts. I was wrappingbaby in a shawl, when the door darkened and a strange voice bade megood day. It was that of a young lad from the second concession. He wason his way home, and had a message from William. In running Dumouchel’srapids the raft had bunted on a stone, throwing her crew off theirfeet. In falling, William’s oar had struck his left arm and broken it.I thanked God it was no worse. He told the boy I was not to be anxious,that he felt so well he hoped to be able to leave for home in a fewdays. I questioned the lad, and from what he told me, I guessed myhusband was worse than he let on. My resolution was made; I would goand see him. The lad said he had to go home first, but promised to comeback next morning and tend the stock until I returned. Before going, Igot him to fell a few saplings for the young beasts to browse on theirtops, for the fodder was nearly done. Then I prepared for my journey;cooking enough to keep the lad while away, and baking some cakes totake to my husband. It would be past 5 o’clock in the afternoon whenI was ready to leave, but I considered I would be able to reach theChateaugay before dark, and once on its banks I would be safe to geta night’s rest. With baby in my arms I started brave enough, but hadnot gone many acres in the woods until I felt I had acted rashly. Ihad gone over the path only a few times and never alone, so that I wasnot so well acquainted with it as I thought I was, and, from the snowhaving newly melted, it was not as plain as usual. I pressed on untilI felt that I had walked so far that, if on the right track, I shouldhave reached the river, while I had not even come to the Outarde. Thesunlight had long left the treetops and the stars had begun to glimmer,when I gave it up, convinced that, likely in going to one side to passa wet spot, I had left the track, and that I was lost in the woods.Assured I had lost my way, I knew it would be madness to walk farther,and so, while I could see, I picked out a hemlock knoll, and choosinga big hemlock that had some cedar bushes growing near, I sat downbeneath it. It was not very cold, though in the clearances I daresaythere was frost. Taking a cake out of my pocket I made my supper. Babywas very good and lay asleep in his shawl. Wrapping him more warmly inthe long plaid I had around my shoulders, I clasped him to my bosomand, so wearied was I, that I fell asleep. I awoke with a start. Ithought I heard some one calling. I listened and the sound soon cameagain. It was the cry of a wolf at some distance. Another answeredfrom some other part of the woods, and another and another. You havenoticed, on a calm night, how, if a dog barks, every dog within hearinganswers; it is the same with wolves, only their cries are more varied,ranging from a deep howl to a whine like that of a child in pain. Ishuddered for my babe, who still slept, and, kissing him, resolved Ishould die before the brutes would reach him. For a long time I satand listened, until the cries died away, from the beasts apparentlyhurrying to some distant point in pursuit of their prey. I again slept,how long I do not know, but was awakened by something warm strokingmy cheek. It was our dog licking my face. I had shut him in the houseto be a watch on it, but he had broken out some way and, scenting mysteps, had overtaken us. I was so desolate and lonesome, and so gladto have Collie’s company, that my heart leaped with happiness as hecuddled down beside me and would not give over licking my hands andface for very joy. I should be ashamed to tell it, but, sir, a good dogis better than a false friend, and Collie was a most faithful beast.After that I slept with confidence, and it was good daylight when Iawoke, cold and stiff with my first and last night’s rest in the woods,but refreshed and confident. I would not touch more of my cakes, forI wanted them for my husband, so, thanking God for preserving me sofar, I went on my way, baby crowing at the sight of Collie, as hegamboled around us with yelps. Marking as well as I could from theway his rays fell, where the sun rose, I went north, for I knew thatin that direction I would soon come across the Outarde. Sure enough,I had not gone a quarter of a mile, when I came upon it, flowing redand full, for it was high water. Knowing I was safe, and that I wouldquickly come upon one of the settlers by its banks, I hurried on ingreat spirits, and came out on John Hughes’ clearing, and was speedilyseated by their blazing log fire at breakfast. My troubles were nowover, and I saw that, instead of going north, I had wandered to theeast. A little boy went with me to Strachan’s, where I crossed theChateaugay, and resuming my walk got to the house, near Ste Martine,where my husband lay, in the afternoon. It was well I went, for hishurt had brought on a slight fever, and though the habitant’s familywere kind, they could not nurse him as I did. These were anxious buthappy days, for William was overjoyed to have me beside him, and I wasglad to be of service to him. In ten days Dr Syme told me he would bearthe journey, and getting a cast in one of Reeves’s canoes as far asthe Portage, we were safe back in our own house before night, to findeverything better than we expected. It was a drawback William’s arm,for it was some time before he could do hard work with it, but we gotover that and many another backset, and, if we are now well-to-do, weearned all we’ve got.AN INCIDENT OF HUNTINGDON FAIR.A LOST CHILD.It was wearing on to three o’clock on the first day of the fair, andthe crowd was at its height. At a corner of the main building, wherethe throng was thickest, stood a child, a girl of some four summers,sobbing, not loudly or obtrusively, but with her face buried in herpinafore. The passers-by, intent upon their own pleasure, took nonotice of her, until a gaunt, elderly man halted in front of her withthe query, “What are you crying for?” “For mama,” said the childraising her tear-stained face from behind her pinafore. “Don’t youknow where she is?” “No,” sobbed the little one, “she’s goned away,”and here her grief broke out afresh. Attention being thus directedto the child, the standers-by grew interested. Among them were twoyoung ladies in rather loud costume. “Guess she’s lost,” remarkedone of them. “Want to know?” queried the other, “Ain’t she sweet?”“Some; should say her mother don’t know much; such a looking hat.”“You mightn’t do better, Ethie.” “I’d be sick if I couldn’t.”--“Well,what’s to be done?” asked the man who first noticed the child. “Hasanybody seen anybody looking for a little girl?” Nobody had, and thensuggestions as to what to do were volunteered. “Ask her name?” was oneof them. “What’s your name, sissy?” “Roose,” sobbed the child. “Andwhere do you live?” “With mama.” “And where does she live?” “At home.”“That’s not the way to ask her,” exclaimed a brawny young man, whoselowest whisper would startle a horse, and bending over her he asked,“How did mama come to the fair?” “With me and Toby.” “Is Toby yourfather?” “No,” said the child, smiling through her tears, “Toby’s adear little dog.” “Did mama walk to the fair?” “We’s drove in a wagonand Toby too, ever so long ways.” “What’s the name of the place youcame from?” The question was beyond the child, who simply shook herhead. “Don’t bother her,” interjected a bystander, “get your wagon anddrive her round the ground and the mother will see her.” “I can’t verywell,” said the man of the loud voice. “My horse has got the gorum,and I want to watch the sheep judges.” “Well, take her home with you;you’ve neither chick nor child.” At this a laugh rose, and suggestionsas to what should be done, each more senseless and impracticable thananother, began again. To send her to Grahamie as lost baggage, to seather in the centre of the horse-ring, at the head of the show-housestairs, with the band, or among the fancy articles, where her motherwould be sure to go, were among the more reasonable. Each one wasclear that it was the duty of somebody else to exert themselves tofind the mother, and each one was equally clear he was not called uponto undertake the task. And so precious time was slipping, and what todo with the child remained undecided. At this juncture, a short andsomewhat stout woman broke through the ring. “Hech, what’s a’ thisabout? A lost bairn, say ye.” Bending over, she lifted the child, andsitting down on a bench pressed her to her bosom. “My bonnie doo, andhae ye lost your mammie! Wha ocht ye?” The child, with staring eyes,answered not. “You might as well speak Greek,” grimly remarked thegaunt man. “Eh, what’s that! Do you think she disna understan theEnglish lang’age? Na, na, thae bonny blue een are no French. An hoodid you lose yer mammie, my pet?” “Mama gave me penny to get candy,and Toby ran after other dog, and I tried to catch Toby but he runneda long way and was bad, and--and--I couldn’t find mama or Toby,” andthe recollection of her misfortune renewed her grief. “Eh, ma wee bitlady,” exclaimed the good-hearted woman, as she clasped the sobbingchild more closely, “but hoo are we in this thrang to find Toby oryer mither either. Hech but her heart will be sair for the loss o’ ye.Will na some o’ ye gang and see if ye canna fin a woman lookin’ for herbairn, instead o’ gapin there at us like so mony gomerils.”“If you’ll give me ten cents I’ll go,” said a pert boy.“Ha, ha, my man, ye’ll be a Conservative; ye want an office.”“There’s the president,” remarked one of the bystanders.“What! yon black-a-vised man wi the bit red ribbon? Hey, Mr Praseedent;come yont: I want yer advice.”“What’s this; what’s this?” asked the president.“Jist a lost bairn, an hoo to fin the mother o’t I dinna ken.”“Couldn’t be in better hands,” said the president.“She micht be in waur, tho I say’t mysell. But that’s no what I’mdrivin at. Hoo am I to get her mither!”“Oh, that’s not hard to do. You have seen a lamb lose its mother, butdid you ever see the ewe that failed to find her? You just sit whereyou are, and the mother will come along.”“I’ve seen the ewie seek her bit lammie ower knowe and heugh an neverfail to find the wanderer, but what could she do were as mony auldtups thranging roun as are here? Na, na; yer comparison winna stan,Mr Praseedent. Jest tell me what I’m to dae, an no be stanin’ theretwirlin yer whisker.”“I’ll tell you what to do. Take the child home with you; she is tiredand not fit to stay here longer. The mother will be sure to come to theoffice, and I will know where to send her. I’ll take your address,” andhe pulled out his notebook.Glancing at the child, which had fallen asleep on her bosom, the womankissed the peaceful little face, and replied, “that’s gude advice.Everybody kens me. I’m Mrs Crowdie, and I live on the ----concessionof Hinchinbrook, and if ye want to ken mair o’ me ye can speer at thatdecent man, Mr Herdman, yonner, wha lifts my taxes, and as oor wagginwill be ready, I’ll gang noo. Sae gude day to ye.”Tired with the day’s fatigue and grief, the child did not wake untilthe wagon halted at Mrs Crowdie’s door, when, seeing everything new andstrange, she cried a little for her mother, but was easily soothed,and, on supper appearing, she forgot her little sorrows in satisfyingher appetite. Though Mrs Crowdie had much to do “in settin things torichts,” as she termed it, about the house, and scolded the man-servantfor “thinkin mair o’ what he saw at the fair than o’ his wark,” shefound time to lavish much attention on the waif, so curiously left onher hands, and beguiled the smiles to her cheeks by kindly arts. Whenit grew dark, she cried for her mother, but accepting Mrs Crowdie’spromise that “she would see her the morn,” and that she would “letpooshack sleep with her,” she lisped her artless prayer at her kneeand, laid in bed, dropped into the land of Nod with her arms around MrsCrowdie’s big black cat.A NEEBOR LADDIE.Little Roose was up by times next morning, and thought it grand fun tohelp Mrs Crowdie to milk, to feed the poultry, and to get breakfastready. Everything was new to her, and enjoyed with such a zest as toshow that it was her first taste of country-life. To keep her company,Mrs Crowdie had sent word to her neighbors to let their son come andplay with her, and by-and-by Johnnie made his appearance, and the twohad a rare time of it. It was in the afternoon, when, tired with play,and to rest and enjoy the pieces Mrs Crowdie gave each of them, theysnuggled down behind a clump of bushes in the orchard.“When I’m a man, Roose, I’ll have sugar on my bread like this all thetime.”“When you’re a man, will you have a horse?”“Yes; two of them and whiskers too.”“And a farm like this?”“A bigger farm than this, an’ a big house an’ a buggy, an’ pigs an’sheep an’ hens.”“And may I come to see you?”“You’ll milk the cows and make butter.”“Will it be long time ’fore you’re a man?”“When I’m growed; two or three year; I’m six now.”“How do cows make butter?”“My, don’t you know? It ain’t the cows that make the butter, it’s thegirls.”“And will you show me when I’m big?”“Yes, an lots o’ things.”“My mama has no cows.”“Ain’t she! Why, my dad has lots o’ em and a bull, too.”“I’d be ’fraid.”“O, you are not a man like me. I could fire a gun an shoot a bear.”“Has God cows?”“Why, He makes em, an the horses, an the elephants, an every thing.Don’t you go to Sabbath school?”“No.”“My! I went when littler than you, an learnt heaps o’ things, an gotraisins and candy at Christmas.”“Without a penny?”“Gimme for nothing.”“My.”“I was to have spoke a piece but got afraid.”“I wouldn’t be ’fraid.”“Oh, that’s nothing; you’re a girl.”Here the conference was broken by Johnnie’s offering to show wherethe ground hogs kept house, and off he and his companion trotted toa remote stone-pile, and did not turn up till supper time, when theyburst in upon Mrs Crowdie with the appetite of hawks, and the girl sofull of the wonders she had seen that her tongue never rested until shebecame sleepy. When laid away for the night, Mrs Crowdie sat in thegathering gloom to think over what she should do. The day had passedwithout any one coming to enquire for a lost girl, which very muchsurprised her. So far as her own inclinations went, she would rathernobody ever came, but she knew that somewhere a poor mother’s heartwas in agony over the loss, and she resolved that, next morning, afterbreakfast she would drive to Huntingdon to find out if there had beenany enquiries.A SHADE OF MYSTERY.With many injunctions to Roose, that she was to “be a guid bairn tillshe got back, an no go near the soos or the wall,” Mrs Crowdie next daybetook herself to the village, where she arrived in due course and wentfirst to the office of the president to find out whether he had heardaught. Entering she spied through the net-work that surmounted thecounter a man in his shirt-sleeves leaning over a desk writing, withhis head turned away from her.“Hey, man!” No response.“Whar will I find your maister?” No response.“Whatna ticket is this?” as her eye here fell on a card hung to thewire-netting, and she spelt out slowly, “THIS--IS--MY--BUSY--DAY. Fegs,by the look o’ him I should say it is. Hey, man!” No response, the manof the big ledger calmly continuing to write.“Eh, puir chiel!” exclaimed Mrs Crowdie, “he maun hae a hard maister orbe dull o’ hearin,” and she thereupon rattled on the counter with herumbrella.“Oh, were you wanting me. Want to pay your church seat, eh?”“What na kirk? St Andrew’s, say ye? Na, na, I dinna gang there. Dod!You dinna need to have a seat in ony kirk, for there are a’ kin o’bodies that ca’ themselves preachers rinnin aboot. Says I to ane thatpit maist impertinent questions to me about my saul--an us Scotch folkdinna show our hearts to every Jock and Tam--My man, ye pit me in mindo’ a finger-post, ye pint the way ye dinna gang yoursel. Ye see, I kentocht o’ him.”“That’s a good one,” exclaimed the man of the pen as he rubbed his leftarm.“Gin I had my way, there wad be a riddle afore every college doorto try the coofs wha wad wag their heids in a poopit. I ken o’ somechuckie heads it wad hae thrown aside.”“Not a bad idea. And what can I do for you? You’ll want an organ?”“Me an organ! I’d suner tryst a parritch pat.”“It’s a nice thing to have a little music, and the young ladies soonlearn to play.”“I’se ken ye noo. I saw ye at the show. Ye can blaw a horn but ye cannablaw my lug. I want to see your maister.”“What name?”“My name’s Mrs Crowdie; kent by her neebors as ane that pays as shebuys an is due naebody.”“Oh, yes, I have a memorandum. The boss left word you were not totrouble yourself; it would be all right.”“I’ll gang hame we nae such assurance. I have come ane errand to seehim and I wull see him.”“We had a fine show, Mrs Crowdie?”“Whaur’s your maister?”“What did you think of the flowers?”“Whaur’s yer maister?”“Oh, it’s the boss you want.”“Ay, an I’ll no gang till I see him.”Calling a chubby-faced lad, he sent him in search, and the desiredgentleman soon entered.“And how are you to-day, Mrs Crowdie?”“I’ve naething to complain o’ except o’ sin an a touch o’ therheumatics.”“And what can we do for you to-day?”“Ye ken weel my errand, an I see by yer man ye’ve something ye dinnawant to tell me. Wha’s bairn is she?”“We’ll speak about that by-and-bye.”“We’ll speak about it noo.”“Is the little girl well?”“The lassie’s weel an I’d be laith to part wi her did I no ken thereare they wha hae a better richt to her. Noo, tell me; what hae yelearned about her folks?”“There have been some enquiries; her people know that she is safe.”“Wha are they? I’ll gang an see them.”“There’s no need. You go home and you’ll hear from them.”A good deal of conversation followed, but Mrs Crowdie could get noparticular information about the parents, further than that they weresatisfied she was in safe hands, and they would call or send for theirchild in a short time. Forced to be satisfied with this, she returnedhome, and when Roose threw her arms round her neck in welcome, shecould not forbear the secret wish that the parents might never come.There was some mystery and she hoped that it might result thus. Shewatched the child pattering about during the afternoon, listened to herprattle, and helped to amuse her, and when the evening gathered, andthe sun set beyond the forest, leaving the clouds burning in crimsonand gold, she sat with her in her lap. Something in the peacefulscene stirred up old memories, and, with thin and quavering voice,the old woman began the 23rd psalm. To her surprise, the child chimedin, knowing both the words and the old world tune Mrs Crowdie sangthem to. “Wha taught ye that, ma dawtie?” she asked, as finishing thepsalm, she hugged the child in closer embrace, the moisture glisteningin her eyes. “Mama,” said the child. “She maun be a guid woman, and aPresbyterian, too.” And clasping the child, Mrs Crowdie sat thinking insilence and did not move into the house until it grew chill, when shesaid “the bairn micht catch cauld.”THE MYSTERY IS CLEARED UP.The section of Hinchinbrook in which Mrs Crowdie lives is a verypleasant one to look upon; the landscape being relieved from monotonyby low knolls and ridges which break the wide intervales. In themiddle of September, the bush, that runs as a straggling and somewhatragged fringe over the ridges, was still green, with only here andthere a branch or tree whose brilliant red foretold the coming glory.The day was bright and warm, the sun’s rays being chastened by thefaint smoky haze that softened the distant features of the landscape.Her work being over until milking time came round, Mrs Crowdie took aseat by the open window and began knitting. Her little charge had goneto watch a preposterous hen, which, after being given up as havingfurnished supper to a fox, had appeared that morning clucking with joyover the solitary chicken that followed her; the yellow hairy littlething a source of delight to the child. While Mrs Crowdie’s fingersmoved actively with the needles, her thoughts were wandering away tothe past. The advent of the child had stirred her nature and wakenedmemories, she knew not how, that she had stifled so long ago thatshe thought they were dead. And to judge by her face, they were notpleasant memories. Casually raising her head, she was astounded to seea woman standing at the door intently watching her; a comely woman,neatly dressed.“What’s brocht you back?” demanded Mrs Crowdie, breaking silence, “Itold you I was dune wi’ you; that gin ye had made yer bed, you couldlie on it.”“O, mother!”“Na, ye needna beg; gin that useless man ye wad marry in spite o’ me,has failed to provide for you, you maun look for help anither gate.”“I have not come to beg; we have made ends meet so far.”“Ay, by your wark. A fauchless, smooth-tongued haveril; hoo he threw aglamor ower ye I ken na.”“You are too sore on him.”“Ower sair! A useless being that wad talk an flee round the kintry,an dae onything but wark. To think that ye wad prefer sic na ane toyer ane mither, you ungrateful hussy. But its aye the way; the best o’women get the lavins o’ men.”“It’s not for me to listen to such talk of my husband,” said thedaughter, coloring.“A bonny husband! Merry’t ye, thinking he could hang up his hat in myhoose and sorn on me. My certie, I sorted him! Gang back to yer husbandan wark yer finger-nails aff to make up for his laziness. You made yourchoice, an I’m dune with baith you an him.”Resentment struggled in the breast of the young woman with affection;it was for a moment only; her better nature triumphed.“I have not come, mother, to ask of you anything but your love and”--“An what?” asked the mother, in a voice shrill from suppressed emotion,“Did I no nestle you in my bosom an care for you as dearer than mylife? When, ane by ane, your brithers an sisters gaed awa an you wereleft the ae lam oot o’ the flock; when God in his providence took yourfaither to Himsel an I was left alane, it was you that gied me heart towrastle wi’ the warl, an I watched ower you an thocht you wad be a propto my auld age. Oh, hoo could ye have the heart to leave me?”“I love you better than I ever did, mother, but you wouldn’t think muchof me as a wife were I to say I did wrong in marrying.”“Aye, there it is; the shuffling creature wi his sleek manners that cambetween you an me.”“Oh, mother, leave that alone. I am sorry to have vexed you today.I never meant to trouble you, until you saw fit to send for me or Ithought you needed my help.”“An what has brocht ye, then?”“I’ve come for Ruth.”The old woman sank back in her chair in speechless astonishment. Atlast she whispered, “An she’s your bairn! I thocht there was somethingaboot her that was familiar to me: that explains it a’. She’s yerselfower again when ye were a bit toddler. O that thae days were backagain! An hoo did ye lose her?”“It’s six years since I left you, mother, and my heart wearied amongthe Yankees to see dear old Huntingdon again. I watched the Gleanerwhen the show was to be, and arranging to be away a fortnight I camewith Ruth and stayed with cousin on the river. I saw you at the show,but you did not see me. In the crowd I lost Ruth. I was here and thereseeking for her, when a man told me he had seen a little girl, dressedlike mine, in a wagon that drove towards the village. I followed andfound he was wrong. Thinking she had driven home with our friends, Ihastened to cousin’s, but she was not there. What a night I spent! Nextmorning I went back to the show grounds, and was struck dumb when thepresident told me where she was. I explained it all to him. He wasvery kind and said if I would leave it in his hands he would manage it;when you came in he would put you off for a day or two. Last night hesent me word things had worked well, and I was to go out to you myself.If there is any plot about it to bring us together without your will,it’s none o’ mine,” and sinking before her mother she buried her headin her lap and wept.What Mrs Crowdie would have done; whether her resentment would havereturned and she again have driven away her daughter, God alone knows,but at this juncture the patter of little feet was heard on the galleryand Ruth, with her pinafore full of golden-rod, came shouting, “Seewhat I have got.” One glance at the tearful face upraised to seeher, and there was a glad scream of “Mama.” Clasping her child andgrandchild in her arms, Mrs Crowdie broke down. “It’s the Lord’s wark;nane save Himsel could hae brocht us thus thegither, an I’se no fechtagainst His will. By a lost child I’ve found my ain, an we’ll neverpairt. Ay, my bonny Ruth, I’m your grannie, and ye’ll bide we me, anhelp me tak care o’ the hens an the turkeys, and the lave.”“And, papa.”“I’ll thole him for your sake; maybe I have wranged him in myprejudices. We’ll sen for him.”“An Toby, too?”“That’s cousin’s dog, Ruth,” said her mother, smiling in her joy.“Ay, Ruth,” said Mrs Crowdie, “we’ll get the dowg too, and we’ll letbyganes be byganes and begin a new life an ther’ll no be a happierfamily in a’ Hinchinbrook. Eh, hoo true’s the Scripter in mair sensesthan ane. An a little child shall lead them. Hech, but this’ll no dae.There’s the nock chappin five, an the coos are comin up the lane, anthe fire’s to kinle. Let’s be steerin an get the wark dune an thenwe’ll hae supper ance mair thegither.”THE SUMMER OF SORROW.LOOKING FOR THE BOOK.You want to see the little buk I have? An who tould you about it?You’ll do it no harm. Maybe you won’t get the chance. It’s not thelikes of you that should have it. You’ve driven from Huntingdon onpurpose and sure I won’t disappoint you. I didn’t ax you to come, didI? You’ll print it. Yis, what suits you: laving out all that tells howwe poor Catholics were used in Ireland. Honor bright, you’ll printevery word of the little buk. Maybe you would and maybe you wouldn’t,but it is not to everybody I would give a reading of my poor nevy’sbook, and, if you plaze, we’ll say no more about that same. Well, then,I might tell you what I saw myself at the favor sheds. Did you everknow anybody who seen a ghost like to talk about it? I tries to forgitwhat I saw and heard, an thank nobody that brings me in mind o’t. Comenow, I’ll tell you a bettor shtory than about poor women and childer adyin by the score of favor an strong men alayin aside them too waketo git thim a cup o’ wather. An its a thrue story, which is more thancan be said about some you’ve prented. Whin I wint to William Bowron tobuy my lot, I paid my money down for’t in goold. He wrote my ticket forthe lot an’ whin he hands it to me, says he, Now you’ve got a farrum,my man, you’ll want a cow. Thrue for you, says I, I had always a cow inIreland an my father afore me. Confound it all, says he, then you musthave one in Canada; I have a heifer that’ll suit you. Gittin aff hischair, he placed his stick across his back and hooked his elbows overit, an tuk me into his yard, where he pointed to a beauty av a crathur.How much? says I. Three pounds, says he, Done, says I, an’ puttin myhand in my pocket I pays him the money in his fisht. Sure the bastewud have cost tin poun in Ireland. Confound it all, says he, ye’re adacint fellow; come in an have a bite to ate. An afther I had my dinnerI started for my farm, adrivin my springer afore me through the woods,feelin proud as Punch over my bargain. It was not until I stood aforethe bit shanty I had got raised, that the thought came on me all atonce, that I had nothing to feed the baste. Och, it takes an Irishmanto jump before seeing where his feet will fall. Well, I held my whisht,and my woman and her good mother comes out and falls admirin the baste.There was only another cow in the settlement; wan ould Armstrong had.Sure, I cries, won’t the nabors be invying us! Thim here long afore usan widout a four-footed baste, barrin pigs an dogs an cats, an here,the firsht month we come, we have an illigant heifer, new come in.“She’s a beauty, sure,” says my wife’s mother, “an as like the wan Isould when I left the Ould Counthry (bad luck to the day I left it) asa red wan can be like a black; lave her to me, I’ll look afther her.”Indeed an I will, says I, for if you don’t she’ll die, for sorra a bitehev I got for her. An so it was, the ould woman took charge and tendedher as if she had been her child, herdin her in the woods an atakinher to the creeks where she could get a bellyful, a drivin her homeagainst nightfall. It divarted the ould woman, who had all the timebeen lamenting laving Ireland, and sarved us, for me wife an mysilfwere workin hard in makin a clearance to get in a few praties. It wason in August that wan night the ould woman an the cow did not comehome. She’ll hev lost her way, says my wife to me. Not at all, I tellsher, she knows the woods as well by this time as ever she did the bogof Dorroghmore. Thin, why’s she not here? asks she. Och, she’ll haveshtrayed furder than ordinar an daylight has failed her. Niver throubleyer mind; she’ll be here with the sun tomorrow. I was more consarnedthan I let on, but what could I do? It was dark an there was no usegoing looking for her in the woods wid a candle, seein’ we hadn’t wan.My wife couldn’t get a wink o’ sleep, an sot at the door, shoutingwhiniver she thought she heard a rustlin in the bush. The day brokean the sun climbed up until he was high enough to look over the treetops at us an say Good mornin, an nivir a sign o’ the ould woman orthe cow. We waited an waited, expectin ivery minute to see her, untilI got afeard, an wint an tould the nearest nabors. They were consarnedat the news an agreed if she did come back afore, they would warn thesettlement an ivery man jack o’ thim would turn out next mornin to luk.An they did; och but there was a crowd ov them, some wid guns an somewid horns an some wid pitchforks. There was grain awaitin to be shore,but not a sowl of mankind stayed away. What’s that you say? They’d beArangemen? What ilse was there in the sittlemint then? We didn’t talkin thim days about what makes strife, but lived as frindly as naborscould, helpin wan another, an niver askin what you were. Well, it wasa fine day, tho hot, an aff we started, watchin for foot tracks anshoutin an blowin horns an firing shots, expectin the ould woman wouldhastin to us on hearin where we were. It was niver a bit o’ use. Hourswint by an we thravelled miles on miles an niver a sign. Whin we founda track we soon lost it, for the woods were cut up by slues. It wasagrowin late whin a few o’ us met to talk it over. “We’ve gone northan east an wist,” says Sam Foster, the ouldest settler ov us all ana knowledgable man, “an havn’t found her or the cow. That shows meshe has crossed the swamp to the south an gone towards the lines.” Weagreed to this rasonin an shtarted aff for the swamp, which was asdirthy a puddle o’ black wather an green skum as there was in Ameriky.Sam was our guide, or we might av been thryin to crass it to this day.He knew where it was narrowest an by creeping along fallen trees wereached the ridge beyant, an hadn’t gone half a mile afore we struckthe footprints of an ould woman an a cow. How did I know it was thefootprints ov an ould woman? Hould yer whisht or I won’t be atellinyou any more. It was a blessin we did, for it wad soon hev been toodark to have followed them up. I tell ye, we forgot our tiredness anhunger, an hurried on in great spirits, an in half an hour Sam shouts,“There she is,” apointin through the trees. I shouts Whuroo an dashesahead o’ them all an in a minit I had the ould woman in my arms an thecow a lookin on as innocint as if it had niver played thricks whin acalf. The saints be praised ye are not kilt and ded, I cries, as Ihugged her, for sure, though she was ould an wrinkled an bint, she wasthe mother o’ my darlin wife. Ded I wad hev been, says she, cryin widjoy, but for the crathur, an niver ben waked or buried. By this timethe rist o’ the min kem up an awl sat down to hear the ould woman’sshtory. She tould us how, from the drouth, the cow found little to pickand kept amovin on and on until she was floundering in the swamp, anwhin they got on solid land sorra the wan of thim knew where they were.“How did ye keep alive?” asks a man, “for ye are spry and hearty.” “Iwunna tell ye,” says she. “Two days and two nights in the bush,” saysanother, “an you not hungry: it’s a mysthery.” “Hould yer whisht,” saysanother, “it’s a miracle: there be good people in thim woods as wellas on the hills ov Ould Oireland.” It was growin late an there was notime for more talk an we shtarted for home, an, bedad, the ould womanbate us all wid the nimbleness she tripped through the bush an over thelogs. Whin we got home, an glad my wife was when she hugged her ouldmother, an the nabors left, I axed again how she had kept body an sowlso well together in the bush. “I wunna tell ye,” says she again, an affshe wint to bed. I tould all to my wife an axed her to find out, andby-and-bye she got it as a great saycret--the ould woman sucked the cowfor food an purticted hersilf from the cowld ov the night by sleepingaside her.“Are you done, grandpa?”I turned, a girl stood behind us, having come unnoticed.“Yis, yis; what is it?”“Supper is ready, and I’ve been waiting ever so long to tell you.”“Come,” said the old man to me as he rose, “an have a bite.”I followed and when after tea I rose to take my horse for my homewardjourney, my eyes must have expressed what courtesy kept my tongue fromagain asking. “Och, the little buk, is it. Well, I’ll trust ye wid it.”Leaving the room he returned with what looked like a greasy and muchhandled pass-book. “Take care of it,” he exclaimed with emotion, “andon’t keep it long.” Placing it in my pocket we parted.HOW THE BOOK WAS GOT.On retiring to my room that night, I examined the book given me withsuch reluctance and read every word of it before going to bed. I foundit to be the diary of an Irishman who had left his country during thefamine. In the ship on which he embarked for Canada typhus fever brokeout and the incidents of the horrors of the voyage and of the equalhorrors of the quarantine sheds on being landed at Grosse isle weredescribed with a simplicity and directness that alternately moved me totears and filled my bosom with indignation. Next day I set to work tocopy the diary. On considering the matter I saw it would be necessaryto learn somewhat of the writer, who he was, whether he survived theplague, and if he did, where he was now. The first day I could get awayfrom duty found me on the road to interview the old man a second time.On restoring to him the book I expressed freely my indignation at theconduct of the landlords, of the ship-agents, and of the quarantineofficers, and my pity for those whom they oppressed. My words seemed tobe unlooked for.“Begorra,” said the old man, “I didn’t expict this aff ye. I tuk ye forwan that thought anything good enough for the likes of us.”Explaining my wish to publish the diary I asked him to tell me what heknew about its writer.“Sure he was my nevy, an I will tell ye awl about him.”Though it was mid-October the day was warm and the sun unpleasantlyhot, and the old man suggested we should go to the orchard, where hecould tell me what he knew without interruption. It proved a longinterview for I had many questions to ask and the substance of hisstatement, though not in his words, I will now give as an introductionto the diary.It was in the year 1847 myself and wife were behind the house cuttinghay. There was no mowing-machine those days; no, not even a scythecould be used because of the stumps, and we were picking the locksof hay out atween the stones and stumps with our hooks. It was a hotday and we had been at work since sunrise, so our backs were tiredenough, but we could not rest, for there was much to do and we had nohelp beside ourselves. We were working hard and fast, when a voice cameahint us that made us start.“Uncle, wanna you look roun at me?”There stood a girl, with a bundle in her right hand. By her figure youmight say she was 17 or thereabout; by her face she was an old woman,for the bones were sticking out of the tight drawn skin and her skinwas a deadly grey, with black streaks above and below the eyes. Myfirst thought was the colleen was demented.“God save you kindly,” says I, “but why do you name me uncle?”“I am your brother’s child.”You might have knocked me down with a feather, I was so astonished.“What! me brother Jerry?”“That same,” answers she in a wake voice.“Where is he?” shouts I, throwing down my hook. “Lade me to him. Nivera line did he send to tell us he was laving Ireland, but welkim he andhis as the flowers in May to the best I have.”The girl didn’t stir; she seemed numbed and dead like and answered inher hollow voice, “He’s dead thim three weeks.”“God save us all,” I shouted, “you are mad my colleen, and ye’re mind’sawandering. My brother Jerry is in Ireland with his wife and thechilder, and ye’re mistaen when you call me uncle.”“No, no,” she says to me, “ye’re my own uncle for I axed at the housenext to you. My mother, my father, my brothers and sisters are wid thesaints in glory,” and wid that she lifted her eyes and crosses herself.“When and where?” I shouted in desperation.“They died ov the ship favor, part are buried in the say and part atthe favor sheds.”With those words the truth of all she said burst on me and I staggered,for my head swam, and I had to throw myself down on the meadow, butmy wife rushed past and clasped the poor child in her arms, “I’ll bemother to you, and, God help us, it won’t be on our account if the tearo’ sorrow come again to your eye.”The poor thing didn’t respond as you might expect, but sank on mywife’s bosom and looked about with that stony stare of hers. My wife’shot tears were raining on her face, when she whispered, “Wad ye give mea bite to eat?”Then we saw it all. The girl was starving. I caught her up in myarms--she was no heavier than many a baby--a bag of bones--and I ranwith her to the house, crying to my wife to hurry and get somethingready. Had ye seen her look at the food as my wife brought it out ofthe cellar, with the eye of a wild beast, you would have shivered.“Draw in,” says I, “it’s coorse, but it is the best we have, anthere’s plenty av it.”“Is the mate for me?” she asks doubtful like.“Surely,” says I.“I havn’t put a tooth mark on mate for three years,” says she simplelike.I reached her a rib of cold boiled pork and she smiled for thefirst time, and sucked it as a child does the orange it wants tohave the taste of as long as possible. When she had eaten as muchas my wife thought safe, she took and laid her on our own bed, andwilling she was, for she was clean beat out, and went to sleep whenher head touched the pillow. Then we had a talk. She had come fromthe fever sheds and might give the disease to the children, who hadgone berrying, so I goes, as agreed on, and meets them, tells themof their new cousin from Ireland, who had come to us sick, and takesthem to stay with a neighbor for the night. Next morning I off to thehay before sunrise and worked excited like till the sun got high andoverpowering, when I says to myself, “I’ll take a rest and go andsee my brother’s child.” She was sitting at the door, where the hopsclustered round her, and looked another crathur. The fearsome glare ofhunger in the eye was gone and there was a glint of color in the cheekas she rose to welcome me. “You don’t think me mad today, uncle?” sheasks me. “God forgive me,” says I, “for the word--.” With that she putsher hand over my mouth. Oh she was the kindly crathur, and now thatshe was clean and fresh dressed I could see would be a handsome lasswhen there was more mate on her bones. My wife had been looking for mycoming and had the table spread, and after we had eaten we sat again inthe shade at the door and as I smoked my pipe Ellen told her story. Itwas, more the pity, a common enough one in those days. The failure ofthe potatoes had left my brother unable to get enough for his family toeat let alone pay the rent. On the back of the hunger came sickness andwhen things had got to be as bad as they could, the agent comes roundand tells him if he would give up his houlding and go to Canada thelandlord would forgive him the rent, pay the passage-money and a poundahead on landing at Quebec. He took the offer as his neighbors did andwent to Dublin, where they found a ship waiting for them. They werenot out of sight of land when the fever broke out and the children,one after another, took it, and three died at sea. When quarantine wasreached they were all sent ashore, and there the rest of the children,saving Ellen, died, with the father and mother. When the fever lefther she was put on board a steamer for Montreal, and got sorra a bitefrom the hour she left until she landed, though it took the boat 36hours. Faint and sick she was hurried ashore and when she made forthe city a policeman turned her back and she sat down on the wharf,wishing to die. By and by a man comes along and by his dress she knewhe was a minister, though not of our sort. He spoke to her and shetold him she wanted to get to me, and showed my address on a bit ofpaper she carried in her bosom. He read it and saying to follow him,led to a steamer lying in the canal. He sought out the captain andtold him to take the girl and land her at Beauharnois, and the captainpromised he would to oblige the minister and refused the dollar heoffered. The stranger handed it to her with the words, “I must leaveyou, for others are perishing,” and slipped away before she could thankhim. That evening she was landed at Beauharnois and when the steamerleft the wharf for the Cascades she felt more lost than ever, for sheheard nothing but French, and not a word she understood. She spieda man putting bags of flour in a cart with a face that she thoughtwas that of an Old Countryman. She went up to him and he answeredher in English, or rather Scotch, for I know him well; he lives nearthe Meadows. She told where she wanted to go. “You’ll be ane o’ thaeemigrants,” says he, “an may hae the fever.” “I’ve had it,” says Ellen,“an am well again.” “Aye, but ye may give it to ither folk.” At thisa Frenchman came up to speak to the man and on seeing Ellen put hishand to his mouth and drew back. “Louis,” says the Scotchman, “takthis lassie hame wi you and give her a nicht’s lodgin.” Louis shook hishead. “I’ll pay you, man,” shouted the Scotchman. “No, no,” said Louis,making a sign of horror, “me not let her in my house.” “You are a’ o’ae kirk and suld be kind to ane anither.” Without replying, Louis left.“Weel, lassie, gin they’ll no gie you cover in this town, ye maun gaewi me,” and with that he went into the tavern at the head of the wharfand came back with some bread in his hand for her. He spread his horseblanket on the bags for her to sit on and off they started. It was along drive in the dark, for the horse walked every step of the way, andEllen fell asleep. On waking at the rumbling of the cart ceasing, shefound they were standing in a farm-yard. The night was clear but cold,but she had not felt it, for the Scotchman had tucked his big coataround her. He told her he dare not take her to the house for fear ofinfecting the children. Lighting a lantern he showed her to a cornerof the barn, where she lay down to sleep, while he went to unyoke hishorse. On waking in the morning she stepped into the yard, where shefound the Scotchman unloading his cart. “I’ve been waitin for you,”says he, “an dinna tak it unkind if I say you maun go at ance on yerway. Were my naebors to hear o’ ane wha has been sick o’ the fever beinhere, my place wad be shunned.” Putting something to eat in her hand hebade her follow him, and pointed out the road she was to take for heruncle’s place, and by observing his directions had succeeded.“An so there’s only yirsilf left?” asks my wife.“Av our family,” says she, “but unless he’s dead since I left, there’smy cousin Gerald in the fever sheds at quarantine.”Gerald was my sister’s only child and I had heard after her death hehad gone to Maynooth to be a priest.“Do you tell me my nephew, that rode on my knee the day I left Ireland,is in Canada? Why did he not come wid you?”Then she explained; told us of what he had been to the sick and dyingand how the day before she left he had been stricken himself. Shewanted to stay with him, but he told her to hasten to her uncle andif he had a mind he might come and help him; she could do no good tostay. I jumps up. “I’ll go,” I cries, “and will bring him back wid mehere safe and sound.” As I said that I caught my wife’s eye so pleadinglike, not to go. But I did. I got my neighbors to look after my hay andoff I started next morning, bright and early, to catch the stage at thePotash. When old Mr Oliver heard my errand, he told me to go back to myfamily, but my mind was made up. When my own brother was adying I wasin comfort. I was determined my nephew would not suffer like him andme so near. When the stage came along I jumped into a seat and beforedarkening I was in the city. All the talk there was about the fever,and how the poor creatures were dying by the hundred in the sheds atPoint St Charles. Everybody was in mortal dread of infection and thepolice had orders to watch that none of the emigrants got past thewharves or out of the sheds, but some did, and they were hunted downand taken back. I kept my whisht as to my errand and listened in thebar-room of the tavern to one story after another, that made the bloodrun cold to my heart. After an early breakfast next day I left thetavern and walked down to where the steamer sailed for Quebec. It was abeautiful morning and I thought it the prettiest sight I had seen for along time, the blue river sparkling in the sun and the islands and theother shore looking so fresh and green, with the blue mountains beyant.It was going to be a while before the steamer was ready, for there wasa pile of freight to put on board, and I walked up a bit to look roundme. In turning the corner of a shed I sees lying on the ground a younglad with a girl leaning over him. I went up to them. “What’s come overyou, my boy, that you be lyin on the ground?” asks I. Never a word fromeither. I went close up and I sees his eyes closed and his face whiteas death, with his head resting on the girl’s lap. “God save us, what’swrong?” Never a word. “Can I do anything for you?” I says, placing myhand on her shoulder. She lifted up her head that was bowed down on theyoung man’s, oh so slowly, and looked at me, her face white and sunklike. “No,” she whispered, “he’s adyin.” “Dyin like this in a Christianland,” says I, “I will get help.” I ran back to where the crowd was andtould a policeman. “They’ll be escaped imigrants,” says he, “and mustbe sent back, the villins,” and off he comes with me. I led him to theplace and he flourished his big stick, shouting, “What div ye mean,coming among Christian people agin orders?” I caught his arm. “Don’ttouch them; he’s dyin,” for I heard the rattle in his throat. We stoodaside for a minute or so, there was a gurgle and a drawin up of thelegs, and all was over. “Oh, my brother, my brother, hev you died aforeme,” moaned the poor girl as she tighter clutched his body. “Come widme,” I said, stooping over and trying to lift her, “I am Irish likeyersilf, and will spind my last dollar if need be to bury your brother.Lave him, and I will take you where you will find friends.” I could notloosen her hould on the body. The policeman said he would go for theambulance and left me. I stroked her hair, I talked to her as if shehad been my own daughter; I tried to comfort her. Never a sign or aword. There was a sound of wheels and I looked and saw the ambulance.The men came and I grasped the girl to lift her off the corpse. Icaught a look at her face--she was dead too. The ambulance men saidthat was nothing, that fever patients dropped dead every day withouta sign. I looked at the poor colleen as I helped to lift her into theambulance beside her brother’s corpse, and I knew it was not of thefever alone she had died, but of a broken heart. Och, och, to come toAmeriky to die on the quay. “Drive to the cimitry,” says I, “and I willpay all expinses,” trying to get up beside the driver. “Have you lostyour sinses,” says he, “they wad not bury them in the cimitry; theygo to Point St Charles, and if yer wise ye’ll tell nobody you handledfaver patients and go about your business.” Wid that he cracks hiswhip, and rattles aff at a great rate. “Well, well,” I said to myself,“at ony rate they will be united in burial as they were in life anddeath,” and they rest in the field where a big stone tells more than3000 were buried. I turned with a heavy heart to the steamer, whichwas ringing a warning bell to get on board and lying down on a pile ofbags fell asleep. It was afternoon when I awoke and soon after we wereat Three Rivers, where I went ashore and got something to eat. When wehad left it a while a steamer hove in sight, coming up the river. Wecrowded to see her in passing. It was a sight that sunk like a stone onmy heart. Her lower deck was chuck full of women and childer and men,all in rags, and with faces as sharp as hatchets from starvation, andmost all of them white or yellow from the fever. She passed betweenus and the wind and the smell was awful. A sailor told me steamboatspassed every day like her on their way from quarantine, and never a onereached Montreal without a row of corpses on her upper deck for burialand a lot of sick to be carried to Point St Charles.It was late in the night when we tied up at Quebec and I took the firstlodging-house I found. When I paid the landlord next morning, I askedhim how I would get to Grosse Isle. “Ye’re jokin you are,” says he,“people lave it, they don’t go to it.” I tould him my errand. Says he,“Go home, it’s no use; your nevy is dead by this time, an if he isn’the’ll be dead ony way. It’ll be the death of yoursel to go.” No, saysI, I have come awl the way from Huntingdon to save the boy and I wunnago back widout him. Whin he see I was detarmined he told me how hardit was to get to the island; that the city people were afraid of theinfection and watched everybody going and would let none come fromthere. He pointed to the landing-stage where the quarantine steamboatlay and I went to it. There was a sentry at the end and when I made topass him he ordered me back. “I’m going to quarantine,” says I. “Thedivil ye be; shtand back; ye can’t pass widout an order.” I was pleadinwid him to let me by whin a voice behind says, “What is all thisloud talk about?” I turns and sees a tall man in black, straight as ahickory. “Yer rivrince, this man wants to go to quarantine and has nopermit.” “My good man,” says he to me, “you are seeking to rush intodanger if not certain death. The sentry does a kindness in turning you.”“I have a good raison for wanting to go.”“It would need to be in risking your life and endangering the safety ofthe community by bringing back infection. What may be your reason?”I saw he was a gentleman and his kind voice won me. I told him all.“What is your nephew’s name?”“Gerald O’Connor.”“Has he been stricken! They did not tell me when I was last there. Hehas been one of our best helpers. His only hope lies in instant removalon convalescence and since you have come for that purpose, I shall seeyou have opportunity.”With that he says to the sentry, “This man is my assistant today,” andputting his arm in mine he walks me on to the boat, where even the deckhands saluted him. When he walked away with the captain, I axed who hewas. “Dat am Bishop Mountain,” says a Frenchman. “Bedad,” says I, “theyshpoiled a fine cavalryman when they made a preacher ov him.”The order was given to cast off and on we went, the river smooth as amillpond. When a long way off we could see rows of white tents and longwooden sheds where the sick lay on Grosse isle, and off the landing wefound anchored 17 ships that had come from Ireland or Liverpool andhad fever aboard. The wharf was a poor one and we had trouble gettingashore, for the steps were rotten and broken. The gentleman they calledthe bishop beckoned me to follow him as he walked on, speaking with thefriends who came to meet him. When in front of the first shed, beforegoing in at the door, he says to me, “Dr Russell will take you to yournephew,” and with a bow he passed into the shed. I followed the doctorto another shed and, heavens! when we went in the smell nigh knockedme down. The doctor must have seen something in my face, for he says,“Never mind, my man, you’ll soon get used to it.” We passed alongbetween two rows of berths, everyone filled, and an odd man, here andthere, trying to attend to their wants. The doctor stopped before aberth where lay a young man, with thick black hair. Seizing his arm hefelt his pulse. “This is your man,” says he. I looks at the worn faceand with a trimble in my voice I could not keep back, I asks, “Is heable to go away wid me?”“He’ll go to his grave in a few hours,” says he.“Doctor, dear, don’t say that; you can save him. I’ll pay you well, ifI have to mortgage my farm to get the money.”“There is no saving of him, poor fellow; he’s going as many like himare going,” and with that the doctor moved away.I knelt beside my nephew and put my hand on his forehead. It wasburning hot. His lips were going and he was muttering something, whatI could not make out. “Gerald, won’t you spake; I’m your uncle cometo take you home wid me.” Never a word. I went over to one of the menin charge and he pointed where the water was. I filled a noggin andpressed it to my nephew’s lips and wet his face. I watched by himfor what seemed a long while and saw others die and heard the groansof those in pain and the screams of those that were raving, and thebeseechings for water to drink. I attended to those near by as wellas I could, and it was when I was coming back with a pail of water Inoticed the flush had left my nephew’s face. I was bathing his foreheadwhen he opened his eyes and stared at me. “I’m your uncle, me poor boy;you feel better?”“May God bless you,” says he, “but what made you come to this fearfulplace?”“Sure its nothing; its little to do for my own sister’s child.”He squazed my hand and closed his eyes and I knew he was praying for me.“Bring me a priest.”A man that was passing told me I’d find one in the next shed. It wasworse than the one I left, for it had one row over the other ofberths. At the far end I saw a priest, and found he was giving the lastrites to an ould man, whose white hair was matted with dirt. I waitedtill he was done and asked the father to come with me. I left Geraldand him alone, and the priest had no sooner said the last prayer thanthere was a message for him to go to another poor soul for whom therewas no hope. When Gerald saw me, he said, despairin’ like, “Take me outo’ here; ye can carry me. I want to die in God’s free air.” These werehis very words.“That I will,” says I, “and you’ll be home wid me in Huntingdon aforethree days.” He smiled a sorrowful smile, and said nothing. I liftedhim in my arms and carried him out of the shed. I was powerful strongwhen I was young, and tho’ he was tall and broad-shouthered he waswasted to skin and bone. I laid him down in the shade of a tree, forthe sun was hot. He didn’t look at the river or the hills beyant, butfixed his eyes on a spot that I took to be a burying-place. “Go back,”he whispered, “and bring the bag below my berth.” I went, and found awoman had already been put in the poor bed I had lifted him out of.I reached for the bag and took it to him. Pointing to a spot in theburying-place he told me to go there and I would see a grave with across at its head and the name Aileen cut on it. “You can read?” “Yes,”says I. I did his bidding and coming back told him I had found thegrave. “Promise me, you’ll bury me beside that grave.” I promised him.“Open the bag and you’ll find in it a little book.” I reached it tohim. “Take it,” says he, “there are pages in it I would tear out were Iable. Let it go. Save the book; it will tell to those now unborn whatIrish men and women have suffered in this summer of sorrow.”He was wake and closed his eyes. “Is there anything more I can do foryees?” asks I. “Nothing, uncle dear; the summer breeze is sweet.” Henever said another rational word, for the fever set in again and hebegan to rave. He talked as if he were on ship again and then he wouldchange to ould Ireland and he would be aplayin with his comrades, andhis laughing was sore to hear. Then there came a long while when hewas quiet, just tossing uneasy like at times as he slept. My eyes wereon the river and the ships and the green fields bright beyant, when Ihears him whisper, “Mother, dear, have ye been long waiting here foryour boy?” and he spoke to her tender and soft as he must have donemanys the time in ould Ireland. Then it was Aileen he saw, and itwas true-lover talk. Oh, it was all so beautiful; the poor boy dyingthere of the fever on the river bank talkin so sweet and loving withthe two women who had filled his heart, an its the lot of love a trueIrishman’s heart can hould. I was gripping his hand, watching him, whenall at once his jaw fell and I saw the soul had fled. I laid him outas I best could, and rolling the blanket round him lifted the corpse onmy shoulder and carried it to the spot he told me. There were shovelsand picks in plenty and I set myself to dig the grave. The smell ofthe fresh earth brought back to me my own family and farm that I hadclean forgot that dreadful day, and I determined to be back with themat once. There were men at work near me finishing a long trench, andI saw them watching me and I watched them and listened to their talk.The sun was low before the grave was finished to my liking. There wasno use trying to get a priest, they had enough to do with the dyingwithout burying the dead, so I laid the corpse carefully in the grave,said a prayer and filled it in. I drove in a cedar picket to mark thespot, for I meant some day to put a headstone there, but I never did,for I was never able to go back. When all was done I went over to oneof the men who had been digging the trench that I had seen by histalk was an Irishman. He was smoking his pipe with the lave, who werewaiting for the burial. I got him by himself and told him my errandon the island and now I was done, I wanted away at once. That’s noteasy, he said. There were guards to prevent any coming on or leavingthe island except by the steamer and with a permit. “Sure,” I says,“if I stay here till tomorrow I may be a dead man.” “That you will,”says he, “an thin you’ll hev to go as a passenger in the steamboat thattakes emigrants right on to Montreal.” “I’ll never go on an emigrantsteamboat,” says I, minding the one I had seen. He spoke in French totwo men near us. They lived above Beauport, he told me, and while theycame, like himself, to bury the dead for big pay, they broke the rulesby going home at night, when wind and tide served, in a small boat.If I’d help them to get done, they would let me go with them. The jobwas like to make me sick, but I wanted away, and agreed. By this timethey were beginning to carry the dead from the sheds and tents, and asthe men with the stretchers came up they dumped their load into thetrench. We straightened the corpses to make them lie close, shovelledsome lime over them, and then a few inches of earth, when we were readyfor another row. Then the trench was filled and smoothed over. I hadput on my coat and was cleaning my shovel when one of the Frenchmentouched my arm and I followed him. We slipped into the bushes and wentto the north side of the island, meeting nobody. At the foot of a steepbank we found a boat. We got in, and casting loose the tide, whichwas making, carried us up until we were a good bit from the island,when a sail was hoisted and we went at a great speed, for the tide hadbrought with it a stiff breeze. On landing I did not follow the men,for I had something to do I had on my mind. I stripped to the skin,and spread my clothes on the bushes. Going into the water I rubbed myhandkerchief and shirt and washed myself as I have never done since. Iscrubbed my skin with the sand and sniffed the water up my nose until,for the first time, since morning, I got the stink out of it. It wassuch a warm night, I was in no hurry to put on my clothes, and didn’ttill I thought they were well aired. I may tell you, from the momentI buried my nephew, the fear of the fever came upon me, though I hadnever thought of it afore. Well, when I was ready for the road, I feltsick, but I knew it was with hunger, for I hadn’t broken bread sincemorning. Coming to a habitant’s house, the door of which was open, Iwent to it, but when they heard my tongue, they slammed the door in myface, taking me to be an escaped fever patient. Seeing it was no use, Iwalked as quickly as I could to Quebec, and made for the lodging-houseI had left that morning. There was a light in it, though I knew it mustbe long past midnight. I went in and there were some sailors drinkingand playing cards. The landlord lifted his eyebrows when he saw me,and signed me to follow into a back room. He lit a candle “Were you atthe island?” “I was, and am right dead wid hunger.” He brought somevictuals and I told him how I had got on. When I had cleaned the plateshe showed me to a bed. I rose late next day all right, and left withthe steamboat that afternoon for Montreal. The second day after I washome and thankful my wife was to see me. I held my whisht, and never aone but herself knew where I had been.Well, that is all I have to tell. For a long while after, the sightsI had seen followed me, and at night I would wake trembling from mydreams. That passed away, but I never cared to speak of what I saw,and tried to keep the island and its sheds out of my mind. Did anydie of the fever in Huntingdon? Yes, Dr Shirriff told me he attended45 cases, of whom 5 died. Not many were Irish. Emigrants strayed intofarmers’ houses and gave the infection. Father Kiernan was that yearpriest in the old church at John Finn’s. He had gone on duty to attendthe emigrants at Lachine. Feeling ill one day he knew he was in forthe fever. If he stayed where he was, he would die in the sheds, so hewaited till the stage came along, got in, and rode home. When he gotoff at his lodging, he told the people Geordie Pringle did not knowwhat kind of a customer he had. Next day he could not lift his head,but he pulled through all right. What came of the colleen? She leftus that fall. Her mother’s brother in county Kent wrote for her. Shemarried a storekeeper in Chatham, who left her well off. The littlebook is all I took belonging to my nephew. There were more things inthe bag. I was afeared of the infection and never touched them. Hemust have had a chest or two, but I never asked for them. He was a goodman, and I’ve been thankful ever since I went to see him die.Driving home in the dark I thought over what the old man had told me,and felt how much more interesting his narrative made his nephew’sdiary, a faithful reprint of which I now present to the reader.THE JOURNAL OF GERALD KEEGAN.“The famine was heavy upon all the land.” According to thechronologists more than three thousand years have passed since theevent recorded in these words. Strange that, after so long a period oftime has gone, the world has made so slight an advance in providingfood for the mouths it contains. At school today there was not ascholar who was not hungry. When I told Mike Kelly to hold out hishand for blotting his copy, he says, “I did not mane to: it was thebelly gripe did it.” I dropped the ferule and when the school wasdismissed slipped a penny into his hand to buy a scone at the baker’s.The poor school I have had this winter takes the heart out of me. Mybest scholars dead, others unfit to walk from their homes for weakness.For men and women to want is bad enough, but to have the childrenstarving, crying for the food their parents have not to give them,and lying awake at night from the gnawing at their little stomachs;oh, it is dreadful. God forgive those who have it, and will not sharetheir abundance even with His little ones. I came home from schoolthis afternoon dejected and despairing. As I looked round me beforeopening the door of my lodging, everything was radiantly beautiful. Thesunshine rested on the glory of Ireland, its luxuriant vegetation--itsemerald greenness. Hill and valley were alike brilliant in the firstflush of spring and the silver river meandered through a plain thatsuggested the beautiful fields of paradise. Appearances are deceitful,I thought; in every one of those thatched cabins sit the twin brothers,Famine and Death. As I opened the door, Mrs Moriarty called to methat my uncle Jeremiah had been twice asking for me. Poor man, I saidto myself, he will have come to borrow to buy meal for his childrenand I will not have a shilling in my pocket until the board pays memy quarter’s salary. I respect Jeremiah, for both he and his brotherin Canada were kind to my poor mother. How I wish all the family hadgone to Canada; cold in winter and hot in summer, they say, but thereis plenty to eat. I took up a book and had not long to wait for myuncle. He did not need to say a word, his face told me he knew whatstarvation meant. I called to my landlady to roast another herring; myuncle would share my dinner. He came neither to beg nor borrow, but toask my advice. After high mass on Sunday the proctor got up on a stoneand told them their landlord had taken their case into consideration,and went on to read a letter he had got from him. In it Lord Palmerstonsaid he had become convinced there was no hope for them so long as theyremained in Ireland, and their only means of doing better was to leavethe country. All in arrears, who would agree to emigrate, he wouldforgive what they were due and pay their passage to Canada. Are yousure, I asked, this letter was really from Lord Palmerston?“We have just the proctor’s word for it. Well,” my uncle went on tosay, “the most of us jumped wid joy when we heard the letter and weall began talkin as soon as he druv aff in his car. Tim Maloney saidnothin. He’s a deep one, Tim, a pathriot, an rades the papers. Whathev ye to say, Tim? I’m considerin, says he, the likes o’ this must bedeliberated on. Sure, I spakes up, the besht we can do is to get awayfrom here. In the wan letther I iver got from my brother in Canada, hetould me he had two cows and a calf and three pigs, an a pair o’ oxenand as much as they could ate. That’s not the pint, answers Tim, thisaffer prisints itself to me as a plot to get us to lave the land widoutan equitable equivalent.”With doubt thrown on the landlord’s good faith, the poor people wenton arguing among themselves, until a majority decided to stand outand demand better terms. On hearing this, the agent sent word theymust decide within a week. If they rejected the offer, it would bewithdrawn and no new one would be submitted. My uncle had come toget my advice, “For sure,” he said, “you are the only scholard in thefamily.” I comprehended the infamous nature of the offer. The peopledid not own the land, but they owned the improvements they had made onit, and had a right to be compensated for them. I knew my uncle when aboy had rented a piece of worthless bog and by the labor of himself,and afterwards of his wife, and children, had converted it into aprofitable field. Should I advise him to give it up for a receipt forback rent and a free passage to Canada? I tried to find out what hethought himself. Are you for accepting the offer, uncle?“That depinds,” he answered. “Give me a crop of spuds such as we had inthe ould times, an niver a step wad I muv.”I told him potatoes had been the ruin of Ireland; that placing soledependence upon them had made her farmers neglect the proper careof the land and the raising of other crops. When the rot came oreven a hard frost, such as they had in 1837, when potatoes froze inthe ground, they had nothing. My uncle was a sample of his class.The lessons of Providence had been lost upon them. They would go onplanting potatoes and hoping for days that would never return, for theland had become, by years of cropping, potato sick. Now, uncle, thatTim Maloney has had time for deliberating, what has he decided on?“I mit him at O’Calaghan’s lasht night,” replied my uncle, “an he touldus to rejict the affer an jine the Young Ireland min. There’ll niver bepeace and plinty in Ireland, ses he, until she’s free.”“May be,” I remarked, “but you and your family will be dead fromstarvation before Tim and his friends free Ireland.” I cast the matterover and over in my head while we were eating our bite of dinner, butcould not decide what advice to give my uncle and those who were goingto be governed by what he did. Escape from the dreadful conditionsunder which they suffered would be a great blessing. On the other hand,my sense of what was fair revolted at the idea of their giving up theirholdings, their homes for generations, for a nominal consideration.When my uncle rose to go, for he had a long walk before him, I said Icould not decide then; I would think it over and on Sunday I would goand see them.When Sunday came, I rose early, and let myself out quietly. It was amisty, soggy morning. I stepped out quickly, for I had a good way togo. The walking was heavy, so when I came in sight of the chapel, I sawlate comers hurrying in for high mass. At the altar, to my surpriseand joy, I saw my old companion, Tom Burke. When the sermon came itwas like his old self, strong and bold. He compared the afflictions ofthe people of suffering Ireland to those of the Israelites in Egypt,ascribing the famine to the alien government, which wanted to wipethem from the face of the earth. It would prove as futile as all pastpersecutions directed against the Irish race, which would continue tocherish their faith and their love of country. He carried me away withhim, but his hearers listened with countenances stolid and heavy. Itwas the hunger; they could think of nothing but their craving for food.Father Tom had noticed me, for when I was going out at the door theman whispered to me to step into the sacristy. Passing the word withmy uncle, that I would be at his house in the afternoon, I joined myold fellow student, who would have me to break my fast with him. He hadcome on temporary duty, and I went with him to the priest’s house. Overthe table we recalled old times at Maynooth and were living those happydays over again with joke and story, when our laughter was checked bythe housekeeper coming in to say if we were done with our dinner MrsMurtagh was waiting to see for what his reverence wanted her. “Send herhere,” he ordered. A broken-down woman, haggard and in rags, stood atthe door. “O ye have come, have ye, Mrs Murtagh.”“Yes, yer rivirence; Mrs Maloney tould me ye wanted me, and didn’t knowwhat for.”“Oh, you know what I wanted you for, if Mrs Maloney did not. I wantedto see what kind of a baste you were that would go to the soupers--whatkind of Irish woman you were that would sell your faith to thimwhite-livered divils.”Father Burke here rose to his feet, his face lit with wrath, and hishand moving to grasp his cross. The woman sunk on her knees at hisfeet. “For the sake of the dear mother of God, don’t put the curse onme, yer rivirence,” she entreated.“Why not? What have ye to say?”“The childher were cryin all night for a bite, but it wasn’t that.Little Tim was adyin on my breast, an I cudn’t bear to have him tukfrom me. I wint out, I tried everywhere, I could get nothin, an thin, Iwint to the soupers. It was to keep the life in Tim, yer rivirence; Iburned their thracks an never tasted myself what they gev me.”With a piercing cry the woman fell prone on the floor. Father Tom’sanger passed as quickly as it rose. “Take her away,” he said to thehousekeeper who hastened in, “I’ll see her after vespers.”I rose to go; he was his old self again; and with a hearty word weparted. At my uncle’s house I found a number of his neighbors waitingand we were soon discussing the subject that filled their heads. Theagent had given out he had got another letter, in which the landlordmended his offer, by promising that his agent at Quebec would pay tenshillings a head on their landing at that city, and saying the Canadiangovernment would give each family a hundred acres free. There was tobe no breaking or separating of families; all would go in the sameship. Against the lure of the free passage, the ten shillings, and thehundred acres, they put leaving Ireland for such a wild, cold place asCanada, and to people in rags the thought of its frost and snow wasterrible. My uncle fetched his only letter from his brother and I readit aloud. I had to do so several times, as they argued over particularstatements and expressions in it. The account it gave of his comfortweighed with them. After a great deal of talk my uncle says, “Well,boys, my brother never told me a lie an I believe every word of hisletter. If ye says, I’ll go wid ye, I’m for takin the offer an lavin atonct.” His decision carried them by storm, and the listless downcastmen became bright and energetic with the new hope born within them. AsI walked home, I thought it over. There was the possibility of theirbeing deceived by the agent. They were ignorant of business and couldeasily be imposed upon. Should I not go with them and protect theirinterests? What was there to keep me in Ireland? Everything I had triedhad gone against me. When I was in a fair way at Maynooth, the thoughthad possessed me the priesthood was not my vocation and I left itsloved walls. Failure and disappointment had marked every effort made inother callings since. To give up my situation as teacher would matterlittle; its salary was a mockery. I would see Aileen.Feby. 28, 1847.--Aileen consents. Like myself an orphan, she has noties to bind her to dear old Ireland beyond those common to all herchildren. We will be married the week before the ship sails. Gave upmy school today. As I mean to keep a journal of the voyage, I sat downtonight and wrote the foregoing, to remind me in future years of thecauses that led to my decision.March 8.--Uncle came to see me this morning. What he tells me raisesdoubts of the good faith of the landlord. The agent was round yesterdaywith an attorney who got them to put their mark to a paper. A ship ispromised beginning of April.10.--Walked to town to see the agent. He was not for showing the paperat first. It was a release of all claims on the landlord and a promiseto give him peaceable possession on the 1st April. The remission ofwhat is due for rent and the free passage are specified as the quidpro quo of the landlord, but not a word about the ten shillings a headto be paid at Quebec or the 100 acres per family from the Canadiangovernment. Nothing can now be done; the poor people are at LordPalmerston’s mercy.April 9.--We were married Monday morning, and spent three happy dayswith Aileen’s cousin in Limerick. Arrived here in Dublin today. Theship is advertised to sail tomorrow. Took out our tickets for secondcabin and drive tomorrow morning to where the ship is lying.10.--When the car drove alongside the ship, instead of finding herready for sea she was a scene of confusion, carpenters at work on herhull and riggers perched in her cordage. There is a mountain of freightto go on board, which she is not ready to receive. It was a shame toadvertise her to sail today when she cannot leave for several days. Oursecond cabin proves to be a cubby-hole in the house on deck. We mightas well have gone in the steerage and saved £5. It was late in the daywhen uncle and his neighbors arrived; they formed a large party, andwere footsore with their long tramp. The captain refused to allow themto go on board and they will have to spend the night on the quay. Theweather fortunately is dry.11.--I spoke to the captain on behalf of the emigrants. I showed himthey had come on the day advertised and had a right to maintenance.He curtly told me to go and see the ship’s broker, who has his officefar up in the city. I waited over an hour in an outer room to get aninterview with the government emigration inspector. I implored him toput in force the law on behalf of the poor people shivering on thequay. He haughtily ordered me out of his office; saying he knew hisduty and would not be dictated to by a hedge schoolmaster. Came awayindignant and sore at heart. Looking over the emigrants I can see whyLord Palmerston confined his offer to those in arrears for rent andwho had small holdings. Such persons must needs be widows or old menwithout proper help. His lordship has shrewdly got rid of those likelyto be an incumbrance on his estates. The company is made up largely ofwomen and children, with a few old or weakly men. The number of widowsis surprising.12.--The weather is cold and showery and the poor people are mostmiserable--wet, hungry, and shivering. I went to Dublin to see theship’s broker. He received me very smoothly and referred me to thecharterer, without whose instructions he could do nothing. Thecharterer I found to be out of town; the owner of the ship lives inCork. I returned disconsolate. An infant died today from exposure. Ongoing to see about the innocent’s burial, the priest told me it wascommon for ships to advertise they would sail on a day on which theyhad no intention of leaving. It was done to make sure of getting allthe passengers they could pack into the vessel. They get £3 a headfrom the landlords, children counting as half, and the more they canforce on board the greater their profit. His experience had been thatcharterers of vessels for carrying emigrants were remorseless in theirgreed, and, by bribing the officials, set the government regulationsat defiance. Scenes he had seen on the quays drew tears from all savethose whose hearts were hardened by the lust of gain.14--The poor people are homesick and heartsick. Today a number ofthem tried to get on board and take possession of the berths betweendecks, which were finished yesterday. They were driven back by the mateand the sailors. One man was brutally kicked by the mate. It seemsif the passengers got on board they would have a right to rations,hence their being denied shelter. Some of the men have got work alongthe quays, and every sixpence is a help to buy bread. Again venturedto remonstrate with the captain. He said he had nothing to say to aninformer, referring to my visit to the government agent. I told him Iwould report his conduct to Lord Palmerston, and have just written aletter to his lordship.15.--Matters have been going on from bad to worse. Two more childrenhave died from cold and want. Not a soul in the crowd has had a warmbite since they left home. Their food is an insufficiency of bread,which is poor sustenance to ill-clad people camped in open sheds. Theship is ready for sea yet they will not let us go on board.16.--This morning we were ordered to go on board and gladly hurriedup the long plank. We had not been fairly settled in her until therewas a hurroo, and looking ashore I saw a great crowd of men carryingbundles and babies, with women and children. They were worse clad andmore miserable than our own people. To my surprise they headed forour ship and were soon crowding into her until there was not room toturn. No sooner was the last chest got on board than the sailors beganto unmoor the ship. Before they were done a tug steamed up to us andpassed her hawser. We had moved out into the bay some distance, whenthe paddles of the tug stopped, and we saw a six-oared cutter makingfor us, and when alongside the government inspector, in blue uniformwith gilt buttons, leapt on board. He looked neither to left nor right,but walked with the captain across the quarter-deck and went down intothe cabin. My mind was made up. My people had already suffered much atthe hands of the shipping-men, and I resolved to protest against theirbeing overcrowded. I knew the law, and knew full well that she had allon board she was competent for before this new arrival. I waited myopportunity, and when I saw the inspector emerge from the companion-wayand head straight for his boat, I rushed forward. I had just shoutedthe words, “I protest--,” when I was tripped from behind. As I fellheadlong, I heard the inspector say, “Poor fellow, has had a drop toomuch. Good-bye, captain; prosperous voyage.” When I rose to my feet hewas gone, and the mate faced me. “Damn you,” he shouted, “try to speakto an outsider again and I’ll brain you.” Mortified at my failure andindignant at my usage, I left the quarter-deck. The tug was in motionagain, and we were sailing down the bay--fair Dublin bay, with itsbeautifully rounded slopes and hills, bright with budding woods andverdant sward. To our surprise, for we thought we had started on ourvoyage, the tug dropped us when we had gone down the bay a bit, and ouranchor was let go. Late in the evening the word went round the reasonof our not sailing was that the crew, from the captain down to theapprentices, believed the ship would have no luck were she to begin hervoyage on a Friday.17.--At daybreak we were roused by the clanking of the capstan as theanchor was weighed. There was a light air from the north-east. Sailswere spread and we slowly beat out of the bay and took a long slantinto the channel, dropping our pilot as we passed Kingstown. Storeswere broached and biscuit for three days served. They were very coarseand somewhat mouldy, yet the government officer was supposed to haveexamined and passed them as up to the requirements of the emigrationact. Bad as they were, they were eagerly accepted, and so hungry werethe people that by night most of them were eaten. How shamefully theship was overcrowded was now to be seen and fully realized. There werenot berths for two-thirds of the passengers, and by common consent theywere given up to the aged, to the women and the children. The othersslept on chests and bundles, and many could find no other resting placethan the floor, which was so occupied that there was no room to walkleft. I ascertained, accidentally, that the mate served out rationsfor 530 today. He counts two children as one, so that there are over600 souls on board a ship which should not legally have 400, for theemigrant act specifies 10 square feet of deck to a passenger. Why wasthis allowed? What I heard a man telling this morning explains all. Thegovernment had sent £200 to be spent on relief works in his townlandby giving employment at a shilling a day. When £50 had been paid out,the grant was declared to be exhausted. Where did the £150 go? Into thepockets of a few truly loyal defenders of the English constitution andof the Protestant religion. The British parliament has voted enoughmoney to put food in every starving mouth in Ireland. Half and more ofthe money has been kept by bloodsuckers of the English garrison. I getmad when I think of all this. The official class in Ireland is the mostcorrupt under the sun. A bribe will blind them, as I saw yesterday,when the inspector passed our ship and stores. Wind continued lightall forenoon, and fell away in the afternoon to a calm. After sunset abreeze sprung up from the west, but did not hold, and as I write we arebecalmed in mid-channel.18.--Light and baffling breezes from the west and north-west prevailedall day, so we made little progress on the long journey before us. Oneof our many tacks brought us close to the English coast. It was myfirst and likely to be my last view of that country. Aileen has madeour cabin snug and convenient beyond belief. Her happy dispositioncauses her to make the best of everything.19.--The westerly breezes that kept us tacking in the channel gaveplace, during the night, to a strong east wind, before which the shipis bowling at a fine rate. Passing close to the shore we had a view ofthe coast from Ardmore to Cape Clear. Aileen sat with me all day, oureyes fixed on the land we loved. Knowing, as it swept past us, it wasthe last time we would ever gaze upon it, our hearts were too full forspeech. Towards evening the ship drew away from it, until the hillsof Kerry became so faint that they could hardly be distinguished fromthe clouds that hovered over them. When I finally turned away my eyesfrom where I knew the dear old land was, my heart throbbed as if itwould burst. Farewell, Erin; no matter how far from you I may roam, myheartstrings are woven to you and forget you I never shall. May thecenturies of your sorrows soon be completed, and peace and plenty beyours forever. Land of my fathers, shrine of my faith, a last farewell!20.--When I awoke this morning I became sensible of the violentmotion of the ship. Going out I saw we were fairly on the bosom ofthe Atlantic and the ship was plunging through the ocean swell. Theeast wind still held and we were speeding on our course under fullsail. I found my fellow-passengers to be in a deplorable condition.The bulwarks were lined with a number who were deadly seasick. Goingbetween decks the scene nigh overcame me. The first time I went belowI was reminded of a cavern--long and narrow and low in ceiling. Todayit was a place for the damned. Three blinking oil lanterns cast lightenough to show the outlines of forms that lay groaning on the floor,and give glimpses of white stony faces lying in the berths, a doubletier of which surround the sides of the ship. A poignant wail of miserycame through an atmosphere of such deadly odour that, for the firsttime, I felt sick, and had to beat a retreat up the narrow ladder. Thecool ocean breeze revived me and Aileen, who proved a good sailor,had our modest breakfast ready when I joined her. On revisiting thesteerage later in the day I found there were passengers down with morethan seasickness. There are several cases of dysentery. I asked thesteward to tell the captain. He informs me the captain can do nothing,having only a small medicine-chest for the crew. However he told him,and the captain ordered the steward to give them each a glass ofwhisky. I had plain proof today of my suspicions that drink is beingsold, and on charging the steward he told me it was the custom forthe mates of emigrant ships to be allowed to do so, and he would getme what I wanted at any time for sixpence a noggin. I told him I hadtaken the pledge at the hands of Father Matthew and considered drinkunnecessary. My remonstrances fell on stony ground, for the steward, adecent, civil fellow, sees no wrong in drinking or in selling drink.21.--The first death took place last night, when a boy of five yearssuccumbed to dysentery. In the afternoon a wail suddenly arose fromthe hold--a fine young woman had died from the same cause. Both weredropped into the sea at sunset. There are fewer seasick today, but thenumber ill from dysentery grows. Cornmeal was served out today insteadof biscuit. It was an injury instead of a sustenance, for it beingimpossible to make stirabout of it owing to no provision having beenmade for a galley for the passengers, it had to be mixed with water andeaten raw. Some got hot water, but most had to use cold. Such food whendysentery threatens is poison. Today was cold with a headwind that sentthe spray flying over the bows. Had a long talk this afternoon with avery decent man who is going to Peterborough, Canada West. He thinks itis not disease that ails the children, but cold and hunger. Food andclothes is what they need, not medicine. The number of sick grows.Sighted 2 ships today, both too far away to speak them.22.--Why do we exert ourselves so little to help one another, when ittakes so little to please? Aileen coaxed the steward to let her havesome discarded biscuit bags. These she is fashioning into a sort ofgowns to cover the nakedness of several girls who could not come ondeck. The first she finished this afternoon, and no aristocratic misscould have been prouder of her first silk dress than was the poor childof the transformed canvas bag, which was her only garment.23.--This is Sunday. The only change in the routine of the ship thatmarks the day is that the sailors gave an extra wash down to the decksand after that did no work except trim the sails. They spent theforenoon on the forecastle mending or washing their clothes. Duringthe afternoon it grew cold, with a strong wind from the northeast,accompanied by driving showers. Towards sunset the sea was a lather offoam, and the wind had increased to a gale. When the waves began toflood the deck, the order was given to put the hatches on. God help thepoor souls shut in beneath my feet! With hatches open, the hold wasunbearable to me. With them closed, what will it be by morning? It isgrowing so dark I cannot see to write more, for a light is forbiddento us. The wind is still rising and the thump of the waves as theystrike the ship’s side grows more violent. The shouting of orders,the tramp and rush of the sailors to obey them, the swaying of theship, the groaning of her timbers and masts, and the constant swish ofwater rushing across the deck, combine to make me most melancholy andforebodings of evil darken my soul. Aileen is on her knees, the calmand resignation of a saint resting upon her face. There is a faith inGod that rises above the worst of the world’s trials.24.--We had a dreadful night, and I slept only by snatches. At midnightthe tempest seemed to reach its heighth, when its roar drowned allother sounds. The ship swayed and rolled as if she would capsize,while ever and anon she shipped a sea that flooded our little cabin,and threatened to tear the house, of which it forms part, from itsfastenings and carry it overboard. How I prayed for daylight! Whenat last the dawn of another day came, the wind lessened somewhat inits force, but the waves were higher and stronger, and while the shipwas still shuddering from the dreadful blow dealt by one, anotherstruck her, and made her stagger worse than before. Peering out of theside-scuttle I could see naught but a wild tumult of waters--yawningabysses of green water and moving mountains crested with foam. Thewrithing, ceaseless activity of the raging waters deeply impressedme. Our ship at one time seemed to be about to be engulfed; the nextmoment she towered above the highest waves. So far as I could makeout she was driving before the gale under her foresail, close reefed.It was noon before it was safe to step out on deck. The wind was dyingaway but the ocean was still a wild scene. With little way on the ship,she rolled and pitched, so that to keep from falling I had to clutchat whatever I could get a hold of. The sails were slatting against themasts with a noise like thunder. It was late in the day when a breezecame up, which steadied the vessel and caused her to ship no morewater, when the mate ordered the hatches to be opened. I was standingby, concerned to know how it had gone with my people. The first man tocome up was my uncle. He had been waiting anxiously to see me. His wifehad taken ill during the night, and he was afraid her trouble was thefever. I hurried down with him and found her pulse high and her bodyracked with pains. All that we had in our power to do for her was togive a few drops of laudanum from a bottle Aileen had brought with her,which eased her pains and gave her some rest. Aileen wanted to go andsee her but I would not allow her, the sights and stench of betweendecks being revolting and past description. Uncle says the passengerspassed a dreadful night. The seams opened in the forepeak, and thewater coming in caused a panic, the belief being the ship was about tosink. One old man was thrown against a trunk and had three ribs brokenand a girl, ill from dysentery, died during the worst of the storm.25.--Tired and worn out as I was, I had a broken night’s rest. I wokewith a start from a dream that uncle’s wife was dead. So impressed wasI that such was the case, that I dressed hurriedly to go and see. As Istepped on deck 8 bells were struck, indicating midnight. It was clearthough cold, and the stars could be seen to the horizon. The column ofheated air that rose from the hatchway was peculiarly fetid, but I didnot hesitate to descend. Except for the cries and groans of the sickstillness prevailed. Exhausted by the watching of the preceding nightall who could were asleep. On getting to uncle’s berth, I found himsleeping heavily, his wife tossing by his side with the restlessness ofher disease. She was dosing and muttering, showing she was not herself.I tried to catch the words she uttered, and found in her delirium shewas back in Ireland and to the happy days when uncle was a wanterand was coming to see her. I searched high and low before I found apannikin of water. I raised her head and held it to her lips. She drankit to the last drop. Slipping back to my bunk, I slept until it waslate in the day. My first thought on opening my eyes was, that it wasmy duty to speak to the captain, and as I took breakfast with Aileen Ithought how I could approach him with some hope of success. I kept ondeck watching my chance. The captain came up only for a short time atnoon to take the sun, and then the mate was with him. I knew it was nouse to speak when that fellow was near. After dinner I saw the mate goto his cabin for a sleep, and waited anxiously for the captain. When hedid step from the companion and had taken a round or two on the poop,I stepped up. He looked surprised and as if he resented my intrusion.Before he could speak I said--“Pardon me, captain, for coming here. Ithought you might not know what is on board ship.”“What do you mean?” he asked roughly.“There is fever on board,” I answered quietly. He paled a little, andthen shouted, “You lie; what do you know about fever? You are not adoctor.”“Come and see for yourself,” I said, “you have not been ’tween deckssince we left Dublin.”With an oath he retorted “Do you mean to tell me what I should do? Iwant you to understand I know my duty.”“For heaven’s sake, captain, do it then. Fever is on board and unless achange is made half the passengers may die.”“What change?” he asked sulkily.“The steerage wants cleansing and the passengers need better food andmore of it.”“Grumbling, eh; what do they expect? Roast beef and plum pudding? Thebeggars get the government allowance. Begone, sir.”I was trembling with repressed indignation but for the sake ofthose I pled for I kept cool. “Captain, the poor people ask nothingunreasonable. Go and see for yourself the biscuits and water served outto them, and I am sure you will order a change.”“Complain about the water, too! What’s wrong with it?”“It’s foul,” I told him, “it smells and bad though it be, there is notenough served out. The sick are calling for water and not a drop to begot.”“Not enough served out--what do you mean?”“That the allowance is scrimped.”He clinched his fist and raised his right arm as if to strike me. “Thisto me, on my own ship; that passengers are cheated in measure!”“Strike me, captain, if you will, but by our common faith I implore youto consider the case of my poor people. There are children who havedied from starvation and they have been dropped into the sea. There aremore dying and you can save them by ordering a larger ration of soundbiscuit. There are men and women lying stretched in the fever, willyou not ease their agony by letting them have all the water they candrink? They have suffered everything flesh and blood can suffer shortof death. In fleeing from the famine in Ireland, do not let it be saidthey have found harder hearts and a worse fate on board ship. When youknow a cup of water and a bite will save life and will make hundredshappy, sure, captain, you will not refuse to give them.”“You vagabond,” he exclaimed, his eyes flashing with anger, “if youinsinuate I am starving anybody I will pitch you overboard. Thepassengers get all the government regulations allow them and more theyshan’t have. Begone, sir, and do not dare to come on the poop again.”“One word, captain. I have been told you have a wife and children. Fortheir sweet sake, have pity on the little ones and the women on board.”“Do you hear me?” he shouted. “Leave the poop or I will kick you off.I’ll have no mutiny on my ship.”I turned and left more sorrowful at my failure than indignant at myusage. My appeal did some good, however, for before the day was overwind-sails were rigged at the hatchways, which did a little to freshenthe air ’tween decks. A sail ahead hove in sight during the afternoon,and we rapidly gained on her. At six o’clock we were abreast of thestranger, which was not over half a mile away. She was a small barqueand had lost her foretopmast during the gale. She signalled us, butour captain took no notice, and we soon left her a long way astern.Asking the boatswain why she wanted to speak us, he said she likely wasshort of sails and spars to repair her damage and wanted to get themfrom us. “And why did the captain not help her?” The boatswain smiled.“They cost money and supplying them would have delayed us.” I had myown thoughts about the sailor who would not give a helping hand to hisbrother when overtaken by misfortune. If that ship be lost for lack ofspar or sail, then that little tyrant who struts our quarter-deck isaccountable.26.--A beautiful morning, bright and milder than it has been. Everysail is drawing and the ship is bowling along at a fine rate. I got upearly, being anxious about uncle’s wife. Found her no better. Worsethan that, learned there were five besides her ill the same way. Thereis now not a shadow of a doubt that typhus fever is on board. Sincewe left port, no attempt has been made to clear the steerage, whichis filthy beyond description. When I speak to the men to join in andshovel up the worst of the dirt, they despondently ask me, “What’s theuse?” The despondency engendered of hunger and disease is upon themand they will not exert themselves. The steward is the only one of theship’s company who goes down the hatch-steps, and it would be betterif he did not, for his errand is to sell the drink for which so manyare parting with the sixpences they should keep for their landing ina strange country. The day being passably warm in the afternoon thechildren played on the deck and I coaxed Paddy Doolan to get out hispipes and set them jigging.27.--A dull, murky morning, with a mist that surrounded the ship asthe wrapping of silk paper does an orange. It was almost a dead calmand the atmosphere was so heavy the smoke of the galley did not riseand filled the deck with its fumes. The main deck was deserted, saveby myself and three old women who sat on the coaming of the mainhatchway, smoking their pipes. The cabin boy flitted backwards andforwards carrying breakfast to the cabin, where the steward was layingthe table. The boy’s motions did not escape the women, and I noticedthem whispering and laughing as if concocting a plot. One presentlywent down into the hold, while the other two turned anxious glancesfor the return of the cabin boy. When he did come he loaded up with asmany skillets and pans as he could carry. No sooner had he disappeareddown the companion-way, than the women ran to the galley, which wasdeserted, for the cook, having completed his morning’s work, had goneto the forecastle, where the sailors were at breakfast, leaving thedishes ready for the boy to take to the cabin as wanted. In a twinklingthe women were out again, one of them bearing a big copper teapot,the steam from its spout showing in the morning air. Hurrying to thehatchway they were met by the woman who had left them, ready with alapful of tins of every description. Into these the tea was poured andhanded below, as quickly as they could be handled. Curious to view thescene I went to the hatch and looked down, seeing a crowd of grinningpassengers beneath, who carried off the tins as they got them. Whenthe last drop was out of the kettle, the woman who held it ran back tothe galley, and dipping it into an open copper of hot water replacedit where she got it. The women did not disappear, but resuming theirseats on the edge of the hatch proceeded to discuss the tins of teathey had reserved for themselves. By-and-by the boy hove in sight,and, unsuspicious of the change in its contents, carried the kettle tothe cabin. He had been away five minutes when he reappeared kettle inhand and went to the galley. I stood behind him. He looked bewildered.“Bedad, I was right; there’s no other kettle.” “Anything wrong, myboy?” “Och, yis; it’s hot say water instead of tay that’s in thekettle.” Going to the sailors’ quarters he returned with the cook who,on tasting what was in the kettle, looked perplexed. Accompanied by theboy he made his way to the cabin to report a trick had been played uponhim. Telling Aileen of what was afoot, she drew a shawl over her head,came out and took her place by me in lee of the long boat, awaitingdevelopments. The mate, followed by cook, steward, and boy, emergedfrom the companion. Striding the deck with wrathful haste the mate wentto the galley and after hearing the explanations of the cook, shouted“I’ll flay the----thieves with a rope’s end.” Coming back, he askedme, “What do you know about this?”“That I had no hand it,” I replied, “nor, I’m sorry to say, even ataste of it.” Aileen laughed, and eyeing me malignantly the materetorted, “You know who did it; tell me right away.”“Of course I know, but I would not tell a gentleman like yourself whohates informers. Remember Dublin bay.”He ground his teeth and had Aileen not been there I believe he wouldhave attempted to strike me. Wheeling round to the three old women whosat quietly on the hatchway he asked them.“Is it the tay ye are askin afther? Sure an it wasn’t bad; was it, MrsO’Flaherty?”“Dade it was comfortin this saft mornin, Mrs Doolan, an good it was ovthe gintlemin to send it to us. It’s a captain ye should be instead ova mate, my dear.”“Tell me who stole the tea-kettle from the galley,” yelled the mate.“Och, dear, don’t be shoutin so loud,” replied Mrs Doolan, “if I beold, I’m not deaf yet. An as for stealin yer dirthy ould tay-kittle,sure I saw the boy with it in his hand this minit.”“Come, no prevaricating. You know what I mean. Who stole the tea?”cried the mate.“Mrs Finegan, ye sit there niver saying a word; can’t ye tell thisswate gintlemin who stole the tay.”“You’ll be manin the tay the landlord tould us he paid tin pounds intothe hands of the mate to give us on the voyage. Where that tay wint toI don’t know at awl, at awl. Do you, Mrs O’Flaherty?”“For shame, Mrs Finegan, to be purtindin sich a gintlemin wad kep thetin poun. He’s agoin to give us tay reglar afther this, an (here sheraised her tin and drank the last drop) this is the first token. If yeplaze, sir, it would taste betther were ye to put a grain o’ shuggar init.”At this, Aileen, who had been quivering with restrained merriment,burst into a ripple of laughter, loud and long, and an echo frombeneath showed there were amused auditors at the hatchway. The mategrew purple with wrath. Seizing Mrs O’Flaherty by the shoulder hefairly screamed, “You old hag, you know all about it; show me thethief.”The woman rose to her feet, her long grey hair hanging damp and limp instraggling locks. With a twinkle in her eye she composedly regarded themate and dropping him a curtsey, said, she could “not refuse so purlitea gintlemin. Thravellin in furrin parts is as good for manners as aboardin-school eddication, Mrs Finegan.”With an oath the mate shouted, “Show me the thief.”“It’s that same I’m going to do,” she replied, “Come afther me,” andshe put her foot on the ladder that led into the hold. The mate shrankback as if shot. “Are you not acomin?” asked Mrs O’Flaherty. “Indadeits proud we will all be to see yer bewtiful face below for ye havenever been down to see us yet.”“He’s bashful,” interjected Mrs Doolan, rising, “come wid me, if yeplaze, Mr Mate, an I’ll interjuce you.”The mate was glaring with a look in which fear mingled with baffledrage. The crones noted his state of mind and enjoyed it. “Can ye tellme, Mrs O’Flaherty, where that fine parfume is comin from?”“Is it the sint aff the mate, yer smellin?” remarked Mrs Finegan, whohad relit her pipe and was looking on with a solemn face. “Sure it’scamfire, an he shmells av it like an ould maid’s chist o’ drawers.”“Beggin yer pardon, Mrs Finegan,” retorted Mrs O’Flaherty, “it’s adocthur he be, an he is comin down to see thim sick wid the favor.”With a volley of curses the mate turned away. As he went towards thepoop he was followed by a chorus of cries from the old women, Wunnaye come an git the thafe? How did ye like hot say wather for tay?Remimber, an send us our tay reglar afther this, not forgittin theshuggar. There’s a favor patient wants to see ye, sir.When he disappeared I said to Aileen “none but Irishwomen could haveso settled a bully.” “And no other,” she laughingly replied, “havecaptured a cup of tea so neatly.” Towards noon the fog cleared, and theship made some progress under a light breeze. There was no death today,but there are more cases of fever. The boatswain told me that the sightof the sun today showed we were 600 miles from Newfoundland. Saw thetopsails of a full-rigged ship at the edge of the horizon before sunset.28.--Rained all morning and miserably cold. The light breeze we haddied away and we rolled helplessly until after dinner, when the windcame up from the south-east, which sent us bowling on our course. Ahuge staysail, that had been bent by the sailors two days ago betweenthe main and foremast, was hoisted for the first time, and addedperceptibly to the ship’s speed. Sickness increases and the body of aboy of 5 years of age was dropped into the ocean in the forenoon. Thefrequency of deaths has made the passengers callous, and, especiallythose of children, call out little comment. When men and women havesounded the deepest depth of wretchedness, as they have done, they seemto lose both hope and fear. Uncle’s wife is no better; so far as I canjudge she is sinking. She might rally had we suitable nourishment togive her, but we have nothing. She has not even fresh air, but withevery breath inhales the stench of a pestilence. Uncle, unable to doanything else for her, sits at the head of the berth, her hand claspedin his. We had a wonderful sunset. The change of wind brought warmthand dappled the sky with fleecy clouds. The forecastle being desertedAileen went with me and we sat where, looking down, we could see thecutwater flashing the waves into foam, or, looking up, see the cloud ofcanvas and tracery of rope and block crimsoning in the waning sunlight.The sun was setting so directly ahead of us that it might be supposedthe man at the wheel was steering for it. The glittering, burnishedpathway it threw across the ocean, our ship sailed up.“Sure,” whispered Aileen, “it is the road to the land of promise andthe sun himself welcomes us as we pursue it.”“Heaven grant it may be so, but for some on board the land of promisewill never be.”“Don’t be looking at the dark side, Gerald. See yonder clouds, theirdowny edges touched with pink. Let us fancy them the wings of theangels who are beckoning us to homes of plenty and content beyond thatwestern wave, and cheer up.”As I looked into her face, bright with enthusiasm, I felt if angelsbeckoned I had also one at my side to encourage me. We gazed in silenceat the glowing scene, marked the sun’s disappearance, and the deepeningcolors in cloud and water. Turning our gaze to the ship we could tracethe sun’s departing rays as they creeped up the tall masts. “Whowould think,” I said, “to look upon this most beautiful of all man’screations, a ship in full sail radiant in the sun’s richest tints, thatin her hold she is bearing an unspeakable mass of misery and woe? Howdark within; how bright without. How deceiving are appearances!”“Nay, Gerald, rather look at it this way: How God in his goodnessbeautifies what man mars. Nothing so loathsome the sun will not bathein the fullness of his brightness and glory.”And in that I thought, the sunshine is type of woman’s love, whichis not withheld by what is repulsive and like the sunshine takes nodefilement from what it touches.29.--Uncle’s wife died this morning. It would not be correct to saythe fever killed her, for it had not reached its crisis. She wasweakly when she left home, and the sojourn on the quay, waiting to geton board ship, gave her a bad cold. Her system was so reduced, shecould not withstand the onset of the disease. Uncle wanted a coffin,and the carpenter agreed to make one for five shillings, but when heasked permission of the mate he refused, so she was buried like theothers, slipped into the ocean. I recited the prayers for the dead,and the deck was crowded, many being there who had not left the holdsince we sailed. Just as they were about to lift the corpse over thegunwale Aileen suddenly burst into song--that mournful, consolatoryhymn of the ages, Dies Iræ, to whose strains so many millions of thefaithful have been carried to the grave. It was her magnificent voice,sounding from the choir-loft of our chapel, that first drew me to her,and, never before, did I hear her put more feeling into her voice thannow. When the last strain of melody floated over the waters, there wasa hush for a minute, my uncle laid his hand for the last time on thehead of her he so dearly loved, there was a plunge, and all was over.The breaking out of the fever has produced, even among us hardened tomisfortune, something like a panic. The crew are in mortal terror ofthe infection and will not allow passengers to go on the forecastle,as was their wont. The ship being sent to sea purposely shorthanded,the owner relying on saving something by getting the emigrants tohelp, a few of our lads, who had been given bunks in the forecastleand allowed sailors’ rations, have been warned, if they go down thehatchways to see their people, they need not return. The captain andcabin passengers never leave the poop. As for the mate, he seems to puthis faith for protection against infection on camphor, and so smells ofit that he must have a piece in every pocket. Uncle’s sorrows are notended, for two of his family are very ill.30.--Cold and rainy with fog. A north-west wind is blowing that drivesthe ship at a good rate, though not straight on her course. The feverspreads and to the other horrors of the steerage is added the cries ofthose in delirium. While I was coming from the galley this afternoon,with a pan of stirabout for some sick children, a man suddenly sprangupwards from the hatchway, rushed to the bulwark, his white hairstreaming in the wind, and without a moment’s hesitation leaped intothe seething waters. He disappeared beneath them at once. His daughtersoon came hurrying up the ladder to look for him. She said he hadescaped from his bunk during her momentary absence, that he was madwith the fever. When I told her gently as I could that she would neversee him again, she could not believe me, thinking he was hiding. Ohthe piercing cry that came from her lips when she learned where he hadgone; the rush to the vessel’s side, and the eager look as she scannedthe foaming billows. Aileen led her away; dumb from the sudden strokeyet without a tear.May 1.--Wind still from northwest; ship beating against it in shorttacks. Most disagreeable motion. Cast lead at noon. At 150 fathomsfound no bottom. A whale crossed our bows, not a hundred yards away.During the afternoon wind veered to northeast and before dark developedinto a gale, before which we are driving. May it last long enough tobring us to land. Two deaths today, which has been a truly miserableMay-day.2.--There had been a flurry of snow during the night, so that yardsand deck were white when I went out. The gale still holds and boatswainsaid if the weather cleared we would see Newfoundland. Two small boomscracked but that has not deterred the captain from keeping on all thesail the ship will bear. At times her lee rail almost touches thewater, and the deck slants so it is difficult to cross it. The captainis anxious to end the voyage, and no wonder, for the fever spreads. Onechild and two adults have died within the last twenty-four hours. Theirbodies were dropped overboard when the ship was going 12 knots an hour.A cold, miserable day.3.--The gale blew itself out during the night and today it is calm, theship pitching and rolling on a glassy swell, and the sails flapping asif they would split. There is a mist, and it is very cold, which, theboatswain tells me, indicates ice near. Lead cast and soundings found,showing we are on the Banks. Some of our people, who are fishermen,bargained with the cook for a piece of salt pork and using it as baitcast their lines. Their patience was tried for a while, until we strucka school of fish, when for half an hour they caught cod and dogfishas fast as they could haul them in. The school then left and few werecaught afterwards. They gave a few of best fish to the cook and inconsideration he cooked what they had, so for one day all between deckshad enough to eat. The drinking-water has been growing daily worse,and now the smell of it is shocking. The barrels must have been filledfrom the Liffey near a sewer. Repugnant as it is to sight, smell, andtaste it continues to be doled out in such meagre measure that the sickare continually crying for water with not a drop to give them. Thenumber now sick is appalling--the young of dysentery, the old of fever,the cause of both diseases starvation. Uncle’s second boy died thisafternoon of dysentery. Poor uncle, his lot is a sore one, yet he nevercomplains. Wind came from southwest towards evening bringing mildertemperature with light rain. Sighted several fishing schooners and sawsea-birds for first time since left coast of Ireland.4.--This has been a variable day; at times bright and warm, at othersfoggy and chilly, according as the wind blew, and it has veered fromwest to southwest. Sailors busy getting anchors off forecastle andbitted to the catheads--a slow and laborious task. Passed a number offishing smacks today and sailed through a school of porpoises. Our ownfishermen did pretty well today, The fish they catch is a great boon toour starving people. No death today.5.--Weather thick and bitterly cold; no child played on deck today.Passed large fields of ice requiring great skill in handling the shipto avoid them. Captain remained on deck all day. While I have norespect for him as a man, he is an excellent sailor. Passed two shipscaught in the ice. Boatswain says they will have to drift with it untilthe wind opens a channel by which they can escape. Steady wind fromnorth-east all day. One death this evening, body buried by moonlight.6.--No ice seen today. Boatswain tells me the captain has brought theship well south of it. Weather continued thick, with wind from east,and frequent showers of rain. Passed a beautifully shaped two-mastedvessel, painted white. She hoisted the stars and stripes. Sighted twolarge vessels, one like ourselves crowded with emigrants, for her leebulwark was black with them, looking at us. A patch of floating seaweed drifted by before dark, showing we must be near land. There werethree deaths today. If it please God, may this agony soon end.7.--Stepping on deck this morning to my astonishment saw land oneither side--cape North and St Paul island, the sunlight bringing thelighthouses into sharp relief. Both spits looked desolate, but werea cheering sight, for they were the first land we have seen since welost sight of the Kerry hills. Thank God for his goodness in bringingus to land, the sight of which cheered me beyond expression. It senta thrill of excitement even through the steerage. During the nightthe wind changed to the southeast and the ship makes great progress,the water being smooth, for now being in the gulf of St Lawrence wehave left behind us the swell of the Atlantic. As the morning wore onit grew warmer, and when the sun had climbed to his heighth his raysbecame almost unpleasantly hot. Passengers not seen on deck since wesailed, crawled up to have a sight of the land, which we quickly leftastern, and to bask in the sunshine, until few except the sick remainedbelow. It was wonderful the change heat and prospect of soon being onland, wrought on the spirits of us all. Hope sprung afresh, and themisery of the past was forgotten. Children played about the deck andthe hum of conversation filled the air. There were a number of shipsin sight, bound, like ourselves, for Quebec. The hours sped and wewere bearing down on the Bird-rocks--lonely islets of rock, worn intofantastic shapes, shooting sheer up from the sea and whose cliffs givea foothold to sea fowl, squadrons of whom were careering above them.While intently watching these sentinels of the gulf of the mighty riverwe had entered, my eye chanced to fall on the face of an old womanwhom Aileen had persuaded to stay on deck. More pinched and sallow itcould not be, for she was wasted and worn, but, to my alarm, I saw itslines assuming the rigidity of coming death. I touched Aileen’s armto direct her attention. She was down on her knees by her side in amoment. “Mother, dear, are you not feeling well?” The eyelids liftedand the answer came, “I thank God for his goodness,” and then theydrooped over the poor dazed eyes. I stepped into my cabin for a tinof water and Aileen held it to her lips. She feebly motioned it away.The slip of a girl who belonged to her, a grandchild, now realizingthe coming change, clasped her round the neck. “Granny, dear, don’t bealeavin me all alone; sure we see Ameriky now and will soon be walkinon it.” The soul was quitting its frail tenement but the child’s voiceso far recalled it, that a slight look of recognition lightened theface. “Och, stay wid me, granny, an I’ll do yer biddin and nivir vix yeagin. We’ll soon be havin lashins of meat an wather, an ye wunna needto be givin me your share. O stay wid me!” At that moment there was areport of a musket fired near by. The passengers, grouped around thedying woman, raised their startled eyes and saw it was the mate, whohad fired at the sea fowl on the rocks we were now passing. The angryscowl at the interruption melted again into sorrow when Aileen, liftingthe gray head from her lap, reverently straightened it on the deck,and leaving the body to the care of the women who crowded near, ledthe sobbing girl, doubly orphaned, to our cabin. At sunset we buriedthe body and with it that of a poor cripple, who had been sufferingfrom dysentery. We sat late that night, for the breeze was warm andthe speed of the ship exhilarating, while the waters sparkled in themoonlight. I had been in bed some time, when voices outside wakenedme. It was the boatswain and a sailor who were talking, and the soundof their voices seemed to express astonishment. I dressed and hurriedout. “Is there anything gone wrong?” I asked. “Did you ever see thelike of that?” the boatswain replied, by pointing to the sky. The windhad fallen and glancing up the masts I saw sail, and rope, and blockwere motionless. Above hung clouds the like of which I had never seen.There were thousands of them, all about a size, all spherical, and allplaced together as exactly as the panes in a cathedral window. Thoughhid from view, the moon was in the zenith, and its downward rays fellon the cloudlets, illuminating them and transmitting a ghostly light,reflected by a ghostly sea. From the horizon to the apex the illusionof the clouds was perfect in representing the ship as standing beneaththe centre of a great dome composed of spheres of grey glass, throughwhich streamed a light mysterious and fearsome, revealing the faceof a glassy sea, dark and dread. “What weather does this portend?” Iwhispered. The boatswain shook his head. “It ain’t weather, sir,” saidthe sailor, “It’s death. You see if the fever don’t grow worse.”8.--I had sat so long on deck during the night that it was late inthe day when I awoke. Aileen had gone out but returned when I haddressed and we had breakfast. A western breeze was blowing and theship was tacking. The boatswain told me the gulf was over 200 mileswide so there was plenty of sea room, but before night we found therewas not. As the day wore on the wind increased and the weather becamethick, so that the men on the lookout kept sounding the horn nearly allthe time. The captain was more afraid of ice than of a collision withanother ship, and did not leave the deck after dinner. It was about6 o’clock, when everything seemed to be going well, the ship tearingthrough the water on her northern tack, when the fog suddenly thinned,and to our surprise we saw land ahead. We were not over a mile from it.The captain shouted to the man at the wheel, who brought the ship upto the wind, the sails slatting like to break the masts. The yards ofthe foremast were soon braced round, and the question was whether theship would wear in time to avoid striking, for the land was now so nearthat we could see the foam of the breakers on the shore. There was adreadful period of suspense, during which the ship drifted broadsideon towards the land, until the sails of the foremast bellied out oncatching the wind, when she turned on her heel, and the order tacks andsheets given, when everybody who had been able to get a grip of theropes hauled with all their strength. The ship was now on the othertack, when we left the land astern, and which presented a desolateappearance, a foreground of rock with low hills behind on which werepatches of snow. The boatswain said it was the eastern end of theisland of Anticosti, and had we struck the rocks, those who escapeddrowning would have starved to death, for the island, save a lighthouseor two, is uninhabited. I thought it, but did not say it, for he is notresponsible, that 500 people were being starved to death on board ship.Our having got out of our course, for the captain supposed he was wellclear of the island, is blamed on the currents and tides of the gulf.9.--Uncle’s oldest son died of the fever soon after daylight. The blowis a crushing one, but I have yet to hear the first murmur from uncle.His submission to the Divine Will is most touching. The body along withtwo more we dropped overboard when the sailors were at dinner. Tho’near the end of our voyage, the little tyrant on the poop has given noorder to increase the supply of water or biscuit. I did not think thestench of the hold could become worse, but the heat we had a day agohas intensified it. To descend into the hold has become more than I canwell bear. I told Aileen today she must not even go near the hatchways.Wind unfavorable all day, and ship tacking.10.--Wind again in the south but very light. Today in making theweather tack we came close to the south shore, which seemed to be asuccession of ranges of high hills with trees to their tops. This wasa sad day, five having died. Exchanged signals with a ship. She saidshe was from Liverpool with emigrants and many were sick. Lead was keptgoing all day.11.--In beating across the gulf this morning, the wind being ahead, andcold enough to chill to the marrow, we noticed a small schooner bearingdown upon us. It was a pilot boat that had sighted us. When alongside,a row boat left her and soon a pilot was climbing to our deck. He was aFrenchman and spoke broken English. When he saw he had got on board anemigrant ship, he seemed to hesitate, and looked as if he wished he wasback, with the bundle he had in his hand, on the schooner again. Theboat, however, was by this time near the schooner. “Any seek?” he askedthe captain. What the captain answered I could not hear, for he turnedand took the stranger to the cabin. When the pilot reappeared he tookcommand, and I noticed he never left the poop. In the afternoon it grewfoggy and from the forecastle the dismal sound of the fog horn came.Being now well up the gulf we were in the neighborhood of many vessels,and a collision was possible. We sighted no ship, however, until latein the afternoon, when we saw masttops above the fog. She proved tobe a large vessel in splendid order. Ranging close to us, her captainasked if we had a pilot. Answered yes, he replied he had none. Ourcaptain told them to follow us. Instead of that, the order was givento set more sail and in a few minutes she was lost to sight. Our pilotshook his head as he remarked, “She heading for Mingan rocks.” Whenit began to grow dark, order given to let go the anchor. The noise ofthe rattling cable was like thunder. A child died today, a sweet girltoddler that Aileen was fond of. Many of the sick are sinking tonight,not one of whom but might have lived with proper sustenance, for it isthe period of convalescence that proves fatal in nine cases out of ten.Mouldy sea biscuit of the coarsest kind and foul water simply kill thepatient who has got over the fever, yet we have nothing else to offerto satisfy their cravings.12.-Anchor was weighed at daylight and when I came out on deck found wewere tacking towards south shore, which was concealed by a fog-bank.Afterwards the wind veered to the east, and a drizzling rain set in.Weather thick all day, cold and disagreeable, with satisfaction,however, of knowing we are making good progress. The pilot, like thecaptain, is anxious to make all possible speed, and even the top stunsails were set. This was a sad day between decks. There were fourdeaths and the number of sick greatly increased. No wonder: the air isthat of a charnel vault and the people are so weak from want of foodthat they have no strength to resist disease.13.--During the night was roused by the noise of the anchor being letgo. On leaving my cabin was astounded, for I stepped into brilliantsun shine, in whose beams the waters danced, while, like a panorama, alovely landscape was unrolled on either side. No longer a weary wasteof water, with an unchanging horizon, met my view, but a noble river,rolling between picturesque banks. The north was rugged, with loftyhills, wooded to the summit; the south was an undulating slope, alongwhose lower edge ran a line of small white-washed houses, so near eachother as to form a street. The fields were flushed with green and someof the tree-tops thickened with bud and bursting leaf. Evidently theoccupants of each house had a farm, which ran like a riband from theriver to nigh the head of the slope, which was crowned with woods.At regular intervals in the line of houses there is a church--plainstone edifices with high pitched roofs, which, with steeples, aretinned, giving them a foreign look. We were waiting for the tide toturn, the breeze being insufficient to enable the ship to beat againstthe current. On the other side of the river were four large ships, atanchor like ourselves. As the morning wore on a boat was seen to leavethe shore and row towards us. The gunwale of our ship was crowded withpassengers watching her approach. On coming near us, the two men inthe boat did not seem to fancy our looks, for they did not throw theirline to us. They had evidently come to sell us the provisions theyhad aboard. “Lay to, what are you afeared of,” shouted the boatswain.One of the men shook his blue cowled head. “Parley vous Français?” hecried “What does he say?” the boatswain asked me “I think he wants toknow if you speak French.” “Blast his himpudence; what does he think mymother was? I wants none sich lingo,” retorted the salt. Scared by therow of white faces the men had plainly decided to forego the profitsof trade from fear of infection. One had seized his oar to bring theboat’s head to shore when, recalling all the French words I had everheard, I shouted “Lait,” and held out a pail with one hand and sixpencewith the other. They swung round, and one of the men caught my pail,filled it and handed it back. Pointing to some loaves he gave me onefor a sixpence, and several other passengers bought the rest of them.This done, the boat left. With that milk Aileen hopes to save thelives of the few infants left. The bread was welcome, though it washeavy and had a peculiar sourish taste. When the tide began to make,the order to weigh the anchor was given. The ships to the north of uswere doing the same, and the sailors’ songs came over the water withbeautiful cadence, blending with the chorus of our own crew, whichbegan with “haul in the bowline, the black ship’s arolling,” and endeddeclaring that “Katie is my darling.” With a large spread of canvaswe moved slowly up the mighty river for the wind was light. In spiteof our dismal surroundings, this was a day of quiet delight to Aileenand myself. The extraordinary width of the river, said to be over tenmiles, its waters, pure and of deep blue color, clasping at intervalsa picturesque island, the boldness of the wooded hills on the northshore and the brightness and softness of the cultivated landscape onthe south, were a constant feast for eyes wearied of the sea. The depthand tender blue of the sky, so much more transparent than in the dearold land, particularly impressed Aileen. As we made our way up theglorious river, the shores trended nearer, the hills on the north grewloftier and the southern bank less steep. The sun had set in a gloryof gold and crimson beyond the hills when the order was given to letgo the anchor, the tide no longer serving us. Quarter a mile aheadof us a large ship did the same. The evening being calm Aileen gota wrap and we sat watching the darkening waters and the shores thatloomed momentarily more faint, until the lights from the house windowsalone marked where they were. “What is that?” she suddenly exclaimed,and I saw a shapeless heap move past our ship on the outgoing tide.Presently there was another and another. Craning my head over thebulwark I watched. Another came, it caught in our cable, and before theswish of the current washed it clear, I caught a glimpse of a whiteface. I understood it all. The ship ahead of us had emigrants and theywere throwing overboard their dead. Without telling Aileen, I graspedher arm, and drew her to our cabin.14.--An eventful day, the consequences of which I fear, although,recalling every detail, I do not see how I could have acted otherwise.Anxious to see this country, so new and bright to me, I rose atdaylight. The ship was under plain sail, beating against a northwestwind, and making little headway. One of our lads who had been takento help the sailors was ordered by the mate up the foremast to put torights some tackle that had got entangled in the last tack. The boyblundered, and the mate repeated the order with his customary oaths.Again the lad tried to do what he was bid and failed. Ordering a sailorto go up and do the work, the mate shouted to the boy to come down.He did so reluctantly, for he saw the mate had grasped a rope’s end.Cursing him for his slowness, the mate seized his feet while still inthe ratlines. He fell violently on the deck, when the mate proceeded toshower blows with the heavy rope on the head and back of the boy, whocried piteously for mercy. I could not stand it; my blood was boiling.“Stop,” I shouted, “have pity on the boy; he did not mean to disobeyyour order. It was his sorrow for his mother who died last night thatconfused him.” The mate paused in his lashing of the lad and glared atme with such a malignant look as I pray the saints I may never againhave cast on me. “Mind your business, damn you, or I’ll have you putin irons for mutiny,” he shouted and again laid the rope across thelad’s quivering body with fiercer strength. It was, perhaps, foolishfor my own interests but I could not help it. I sprang at the mate anddealt him a blow in the face. He clutched hold of me and we grappled.He was strong, with muscles toughened by fighting sea and wind, buta Sligo boy of my inches will take odds from no man in a wrestle. Wefell time and again, he beneath me, but he always managed to wriggleup again, until I got a good hold of his neck, then I bent him underme and rained blows on every part of him my right fist could reach.All that the cheating villain had done, his cruelties to my people,his brutal indifference to their sufferings, flashed across my mind,and lent vim to every blow I dealt. How the scoundrel howled for helpand, finally, for mercy. Not one of the sailors interfered. They drewoff to the forepeak and looked on, glad to see his punishment. Thepassengers who were on deck formed in a circle around us, delighted atthe sight. One of them, I recall, popped up from the hatchway and heldout a blackthorn to me with the explanation, “To finish him off wid,yer honor.” I needed no shillelah. The fear that I might fatally injurethe bully alone caused me to pause. I gathered him up in my arms fora final effort, when a strange thing happened me. I saw in my mind’seye, as they passed before me, the white face of one after the otherof the dead I helped to drop into the sea. It was one of those freaksthe imagination plays when the mind is intensely excited. This couldnot have taken over a moment or two, but I saw them all, plainly anddistinctly. Solemnized yet strengthened by the sight, I was given apower I had not. I raised the craven, who was whining and sobbing, ashigh as my breast and flung him away as far as I could. Fortune favoredhim, he fell on a coil of rope, where he lay helpless. The stewardwent to him, wiped the blood from his eyes, and finally he was ableto rise and, leaning on the steward’s left shoulder, shuffled to thecabin. By this time every man of my people able to leave the hold wason deck, an excited throng, eager for fighting. “If they lay a fingeron yees for what ye’ve so nately done, we’ll break the heads av iverywan o’ thim,” said a county Leitrim man to me, and I knew that wasthe spirit of them all. Softly opening the door of our little cabin Iwas thankful to find Aileen asleep. Getting a change of clothes, forthose I had on were torn and bloodstained, I slipped out, had a washin a bucket of saltwater, and then dressed myself. At breakfast I toldAileen all. She was much shocked at the danger I had run, and whensatisfied I had received no greater injury than sundry black and bluebruises from kicks and blows and some handfuls of hair the coward hadtorn from my head, she became alarmed for the result. Assaulting anofficer on shipboard I knew was a serious offence in the eyes of thelaw, and so did Aileen. “I don’t think,” I said to her, “you need feartheir punishing me according to law, for they know if I am taken beforea court, all the villainy of captain and mate towards the passengerswould come out. They have broken the law in fifty ways, and know it.What I fear is the captain trying to take the law into his own handsbefore we reach Quebec.” We passed the day on deck as usual, appearingas unconcerned as might be. Whether the captain entertained any notionof arresting me, I cannot say, for he made no sign. The sight of ascore or so of my people keeping nigh me wherever I moved, from whosecoats peeped the end of what they called “a bit av a shtick,” may havehad some influence in deterring him, but the real cause I opine to bewhat the boatswain whispered to me in the evening, that the steward hadtold the captain the sailors to a man would refuse to put a hand onme. They hate the mate, who, by the way, according to the cabin boy,is lying in his berth, alternately groaning with pain and swearingfrom rage. We made little progress today. The wind was ahead and wekept tacking every half hour or so. In beating up the river thus, aship overhauled us. She was a Clyde trader, and being shorter she woremore quickly and being heavier laden sailed more closely to the wind,and owing to these advantages she outsailed us. As she passed us, hercaptain stood at the stern and dangled a rope to us, as if offeringto take our ship in tow. Our captain, with an oath, rushed down thecompanionway to hide his mortification. In the afternoon a discoverywas made that sent joy to the heart of every passenger. A boy hadhauled up a pailful of water to douse his head in, after getting hishair clipped, when he got a taste of it and found it was fresh. Thetide was out, and at the point we now had reached, at the slack, thewater is fresh. Pailful after pailful was hauled on board, and thesick were supplied without stint, with water sweet, clear and cool.Alas, the refreshing draught came too late for seven, who died duringthe day. I wanted to keep the bodies on board in hopes of giving themburial, but the boatswain advised otherwise, as he said, although wewere within a short distance of quarantine with the present wind wemight be two or three days of making it. Ship anchored at darkening,close to shore.15.--Remained at anchor all day. Cold with strong wind from north-west.At intervals there were squalls, accompanied by driving showers ofrain and hail. Three hours’ fair wind would see us at quarantine, yethere we are unable to advance a yard on our way. Five deaths today. Iresolved the bodies be kept for burial. Boatswain told me mate is worsetoday, being feverish. The pilot bled him and the captain gave him ablue pill. Not being needed to work the ship, all hands were engagedin putting the vessel into her best trim, scraping, scrubbing, andpainting. Outwardly the ship is neat and clean, a sight to delight asailor’s eye, and to look at her from the deck it is hard to conceiveof the putrid state of her hold. The steward bribed several of thepassengers with whisky to clean the steps and alley-ways of thesteerage. A steamer painted white and with a house the length of herdeck, passed us, going east.16.--The sound of the anchor being weighed awoke me and I heard itwith joy. I dressed and gave the sailors a hand. The wind had veeredinto the east, and it looked as if rain was coming. The fore mainsailhaving been set, the ship swept on, keeping the channel as easily as ifpropelled by steam. When Aileen came out, the church bells were ringingfor early mass, and we could make out the people driving along theroads to attend. Reports from the steerage are gloomy. There have beenthree deaths during the night. It seems as if a number of the sick hadreached that point that their dropping off is inevitable. The riverwas dotted with ships following us, and the sight of so many largevessels moving majestically in a column in our rear fascinated me. Byand by the rain came on, when Aileen left to pack our trunks, for weare fully persuaded the wind will hold and that we will land in Quebecbefore dark, bidding farewell to this ship of misery. When quarantinewas sighted, I dropped in to see how she was getting on, and finding myhelp not needed, wrote this, in all probability, the last entry I willmake on board.Grosse Isle, May 31.--Fourteen days since I penned a line in thissorrowful record. I wish I had not lived to pen another. God’s willbe done, but, oh, it is hard to say it. Yet I ask myself, what righthave I to repine? Grievous as has been my loss, what is it comparedwith that of many of those around me, whose quiet submission rebukes myselfish sorrow. Enough of this, let me resume my record. When the shipcame abreast of the quarantine buildings, all fresh from a new coat ofwhitewash, the anchor was dropped. It was nearly an hour before thequarantine officer came on board, and I heard him on stepping fromhis boat apologize to our captain for the delay, owing to his waitingfor breakfast. The captain took him down to the cabin and it was along while before he re-appeared, when he stepped down to the maindeck, where all the passengers, able to be out of bed, were waitinghim. He walked round us, asked a few to hold out their tongues, andthen went down into the hold, where he stayed only a minute or so.Passing a few words with the captain, he re-entered his boat and wasrowed back to the island. No sooner had he left, than the boatswain gotorders to have all boats made ready to take the sick ashore. First thedead were brought up. The sailors shrank back, there was a mutteredconsultation, and the boatswain, taking me aside, told me they wouldnot touch them or even row a boat that held them, and I had better dropthem overboard. “Never,” I cried, “shall it be said that the bodiesof the faithful did not receive Christian burial when it was possibleto give it.” Calling out from among my people four men whom I knewwere fishermen, I asked them if they would row the dead ashore, andon saying they would, the boatswain let me have a boat. Decently thebodies were passed over and we made our way to the landing. We hadtrouble in getting them out of the boat, for the steps of the quay wereout of repair, but we managed it and carried them to what, from thecross on it, we saw was a church. The priest came out, and I told himour purpose. Leaving the dead in the church, we went back to the shipfor the others. By this time the sick were being landed, and roughlyhandled they were. As it would be awhile before the graves would beready, I lent a hand--the most miserable, heartrending work I had everengaged in. With indecent haste they were hurried from the ship deckinto the boats, and tossed on to the steps of the quay, careless ofwhat injury they might receive. Most were unable to help themselvesin the least, a few were delirious. Men, women, and children were alltreated the same, as so much rubbish to be got rid of as quickly aspossible. It was no better on land. The quarantine had only two men tospare to help the few relatives who came ashore to carry them from thewharf to the buildings, and many lay an hour in a cold pelting rain.It signified little as to their getting wet, for they were all dousedby the waves in landing them on the quay. Small wonder two died on thequay, and were borne to the chapel to add to the number awaiting burialthere. The priest was very considerate, and, although I did not ask it,said mass, which I knew would be a great consolation to the relatives.Leaving the cemetery with the priest, I thanked him from my heart, andran to the quay. My heart was in my mouth when I saw on it Aileen,standing beside our boxes, and the ship, having tripped her anchor,bearing up the river. “What makes you look so at me, Gerald? I havecome as you asked.”“I never sent for you.”“The steward told me you had sent word by the sailors for me to comeashore, that you were going to stay here. They carried the luggage intoa boat and I followed.”I groaned in spirit. I saw it all. By a villainous trick, the captainhad got rid of me. Instead of being in Quebec that day, here I was leftat the quarantine-station. “My poor Aileen, I know not what to do; mytrouble is for you.” I went to see the head of the establishment, DrDouglas. He proved to be a fussy gentleman, worried over a number ofdetails. Professing to be ready to oblige, he said there was no helpfor me until the steamer came. “When will that be?” Next Saturday. Aweek on an island full of people sick with fever! Aileen, brave heart,made the best of it. She was soaking wet, yet the only shelter, apartfrom the fever sheds, which were not to be thought of, was an outhousewith a leaky roof, with no possibility of a fire or change of clothing.How I cursed myself for my rashness in making captain and mate myenemies, for the penalty had fallen not on me, but on my Aileen. Therewas not an armful of straw to be had; not even boards to lie on. Iwent to the cooking booth, and found a Frenchman in charge. Bribinghim with a shilling he gave me a loaf and a tin of hot tea. Aileencould not eat a bite, though she tried to do so to please me, but drankthe tea. The rain continued and the east wind penetrated between theboards of the wretched sheiling. What a night it was! I put my coatover Aileen, I pressed her to my bosom to impart some heat to herchilled frame, I endeavored to cheer her with prospects of the morrow.Alas, when morning came she was unable to move, and fever and chillalternated. I sought the doctor, he was not to be had. Other emigrantships had arrived, and he was visiting them. Beyond giving her waterto assuage her thirst when in the fever it was not in my power to doanything. It was evening when the doctor, yielding to my importunities,came to see her. He did not stay a minute and writing a few lines toldme to go to the hospital steward, who would give me some medicine.Why recall the dreadful nights and days that followed? What profit totell of the pain in the breast, the raging fever, the delirium, theagonizing gasping for breath--the end? The fourth day, with burstingheart and throbbing head, I knelt by the corpse of my Aileen. Therewas not a soul to help; everybody was too full of their own troublesto be able to heed me. The island was now filled with sick emigrants,and death was on every side. I dug her grave, the priest came, I laidher there, I filled it in, I staggered to the shed that had shelteredus, I fell from sheer exhaustion, and remember no more. When I woke, Iheard the patter of rain, and felt so inexpressibly weary I could thinkof nothing, much less make any exertion. My eye fell on Aileen’s shawl,and the past rushed on me. Oh, the agony of that hour; my remorse, mysorrow, my beseechings of the Unseen. Such a paroxysm could not lastlong, and when exhausted nature compelled me to lie down, I turned myface to the wall with the earnest prayer I might never awaken on thisearth. How long I slept I know not. Some motion of one leaning over mebrought back consciousness.“Pax tecum,” said a voice I seemed to recall. “Et cum spiritu tuo,” Imechanically responded.I opened my eyes. Could I believe them? It was Father Moylan. I put myarms round his neck, and kissed him a score of times.“Father, dear; sure it must be the Blessed Virgin herself sent you toconsole me for the loss of her daughter, my Aileen, my love.”“My consolation would be of little aid; but as an unworthy servant ofthe church I may be the channel of communicating the consolation thatdoth avail. May the Mother of Sorrows, whose heart was pierced by thesight of her son’s death, heal thy wound. I knew not Aileen was dead.”“Did Father McGoran not tell you?”“Like everybody else in this wretched place his hands are too fullto permit of speech that can be dispensed with. A lad called on me atQuebec to tell me of how you had been left behind and besought me tohelp you and your wife.”“His name, father?”“Michael Fagan.”“The grateful soul; the boy I stopped the mate from lashing.”“He it was, for he told me all and of what you had been to the sickon the voyage. I intended coming anyway to see what I could do forour poor country people, but when I knew of my pupil being here indistress, I went to the bishop to ask to be sent at once.”“And how did you find me?”“By searching. The last hour I have gone through every building lookingfor you and came in course to this outhouse.”“May the saints ease your dying hour for this kindness, father. Oh thatyou had come while Aileen was alive!”“Fret not over the past, Gerald; there is work calling for you whichyou must rise and do.”“I have no heart to lift my head: I want to die and be with Aileen.”“A wish natural to the flesh, my son, but I taught you to little availif I did not ground you in the belief that it is the duty of theChristian to so direct the blind sorrow of fallen humanity that itbecome an impulse to more strenuous discharge of our daily duties.Aileen is dead; requiescat en pace. Is your sorrow for her to be aselfish sorrow that will add to your load of sin; or shall it become anincitement to you to do for those around you what she would wish you todo could she speak?”“Do not ask me; I cannot forget her.”“You are not asked to forget her. May you ever see her in your mind’seye, beckoning you on to works of faith and mercy; may her preciousmemory be your inspiration to do what duty calls from your hand.”“There is no need of my help now.”“No need! I tell you every hour there are Irish men and women dyingwithin a furlong of you for lack of the commonest help. Before I camehere, I found sick who had not had their fever assuaged by a drop ofwater for 18 hours; children who had not tasted a bite since yesterday;the dead lying beside the living, and all because there is none tohelp.”“I do not understand why that should be on land. There is plenty offood and help in Quebec.”“Yes, and so there was on your ship, but a heartless captain and agreedy mate stood between the food and water and the passengers. Thereis abundance of everything within sight of here, yet our countrymen areperishing by the score, because the government of Canada is deaf totheir cries.”“What interest can the Canadian government have in acting so?”“No interest. It is more heedlessness than intent. The politicians aretoo absorbed in their paltry strifes to give heed to a few thousandIrish emigrants dying at their door.”“It sounds incredible.”“That is because you do not know politics and politicians here. Itell you, Gerald, I have been in Canada now three years, and (alwaysbarring the tools of the Irish landlords) if there be a more despicablecreature than the office-hunting Canadian politician, I have yet to seehim.”“If I must act, I should go first to Quebec to see after my people.They were promised ten shillings a head, to be paid by LordPalmerston’s agent at Quebec, and a deed from the Canadian governmentfor a hundred acres a family.”“Faugh! Not a shilling, not an acre did they get. I saw them. LordPalmerston has no agent in Quebec, the government will give no freegrant of land. Mere lies told the poor crathurs to get them to leaveIreland.”“Well, then, I could at least make an example of the captain of ourship.”“Not a bit of it; you are deceiving yourself. The prosecution wouldhave to be taken by the emigration agent, and he would not, if he couldhelp it. Then, where are your witnesses? You would be bled of your lastdollar by the lawyers and do nothing. No, Gerald, there is no use ofthinking of leaving here. Providence has guided you to Grosse isle andhere is your work. Come, man, get up and do it.”I sank back with a groan. I did not want to move, the father insisted,however, and, after many remonstrances, grasped my hand and raised meto my feet. He took me to where the resident priest lived, insistedon my washing myself and gave me, out of his bag, one of his cleanshirts. Then we sat down to dinner, Fathers McGoran and Taschereaujoining us. The conversation was of the deluge of emigrants, everyday bringing new arrivals, and every ship with its quota of sick anddying. Every available place having become crowded, the ships had toremain and become floating hospitals. The calamity with which theywere face to face was so unexpected and appalling that how to devisemeans to grapple with it staggered them. They spoke of the need ofurging the government to erect sheds and send plenty of nurses anddoctors. I listened in silence until Father Taschereau asked me formy opinion, as one who was an emigrant. I said many had died on thevoyage and many more had been landed who would certainly die, but ofthis I was confident, there would not have been a death from fever ordysentery on the voyage or one sick of these diseases landed at Grosseisle, had there been enough to eat. The solution of the difficultytherefore seemed to me simple. Give all who arrive plenty of wholesomefood. Starvation is the cause of dysentery and fever. Remove the causeand these diseases will disappear. It is not medicine and nursingthat are wanted, but food. The people fled from starvation in Irelandto be worse starved on board ship where their lot was made worse bythe lack of pure air and water, of which they had no lack in Ireland.They asked me many questions about the treatment of the emigrants onshipboard. Father McGoran said he was inclined to believe I was right,that Dr Douglas was making the mistake of fighting the fever instead ofremoving what caused the fever. The fever was not to be looked upon aswas the cholera visitation of 12 years before. I left the table withFather Moylan and as we went out at the door, he stood for a minute tolook at the sight on the river. The clouds had cleared and the sun hadcome out strong, with a marvellously soft and clear atmosphere. So faras we could see from where we stood, the blue waters of the river borea column of vessels of which neither head nor end was visible. “Let ustake a step over and see them,” said Father Moylan. When we reached thebank, the sight was striking, and would have been most inspiring hadwe not known that each of these noble ships was a floating pest-house.There was a shout from the vessel opposite us. A man stood on thegunwale, and steadying himself with one hand grasping the rigging,gesticulated with the other. His agitation was so great neither of uscould make out what he was saying. “Speak slowly,” cried Father Moylan,when clear the response came across the water, “For the love of God,father, come aboord; ye’re needed.” There was only one rowboat insight, and it belonged to Dr. Douglas. The oars were out of her and thechain locked. “You’ll have to send a boat,” cried the father. There wasa long delay, ending in a boat putting off from the ship. He wanted meto go with him, but I said I wished to find my uncle.With heavy heart and unsteady step I turned to the buildings wherethe sick were. The nighest was the best. I looked in and to my joyespied my cousin Bridget sitting alongside a bunk. She started andgave a cry of fright when she saw me, for, she explained, she thoughtI was in Quebec and I looked like a ghost. It was her father and hersister Ellen who were in the bed. The latter had been landed sick ofthe fever; uncle had been stricken by it the day after arrival. He didnot know me, and I feared the worst from the sound of his moaning. Thegirl seemed to be doing well. “Comfortable they be,” said Bridget,“this is the best place; the sheds are bad as the ship.” I told herto go and take the air for a while, and sat down to watch in herplace. I was hardly seated when I distinguished a murmur of plaintivecries from every part of the room, mostly--“Wather, if ye plaze.” Ibestirred myself, and when the poor souls found there was somebody tohelp, requests increased, and I was kept going from bed to bed. WhenBridget returned I remarked that I saw none of our ship’s people in theplace. She said there was only room for her father and Ellen and theothers were in the sheds. It was growing dark when Father Malloy cameto the door and beckoned me out. He had such a distressed and weariedlook that I went with him without asking any questions. When we camenear the outhouse I had lodged in, I turned towards it. He grippedmy arm. “No, Gerald, not there; you’d lapse into your old mood.” Hetook me to the priest’s house, and a shake-down was made for me in thekitchen. I had a wakeful night and went out of doors before sunrise.To my surprise I saw Father Malloy walking up and down in front of thehouse, prayer-book in hand. When done he joined me. “Now, Gerald, wehave work to do; we must make an examination of everything, for no plancan be laid until we know the actual state of affairs.” Re-enteringthe house with him, he got a loaf and a jug of milk. “I am going totell you something you should never forget; when you have to go wherethere are sick, do not go with an empty stomach. Fasting and infectiongo together.” Having broken our fast, we started, the first thing tobe done, the father said, being to see what the island was like. Themorning was delightfully fresh and we walked briskly. We found theisland larger than we supposed, and having a good deal of land fitfor cultivation. Pausing at a field where a man was harrowing, thefather had a conversation with him in French. He told him the islandwas about three miles long by one in width, and that Doctor Douglasfarmed a considerable part of it, keeping a number of cows. Standingon its north bank a wide expanse of the St Lawrence lay at our feet,the blue waters ruffled by a western breeze. Beyond rose a chain ofwooded hills, which swelled into a lofty peak, overhanging the river.“That is called cape Tourmente,” said Father Malloy. “Is it not aglorious scene! Who, looking upon it, would dream there is concentratedwithin ten minutes’ walk the misery of a nation? Gerald, we must giveIreland’s woe on this island a voice that will bring the help ofChristian people.”“I am afraid it will be hard to interest them. Everything is againstthe poor emigrant, father. He is not looked upon as a human being. Thevery sailors treat him as they would a steer given to carry from oneport to another.”“True, my boy, and you don’t know it all, for you have not lived inthis country yet. I’ve seen in New York men and women shrink from thenewly landed emigrant as an unclean thing, and at Quebec over therethe very bar-room loafers sniff their noses in disgust at him. Unlessthey have money nobody makes them welcome; and if they have moneyeverybody tries to get it from them. I buried a woman who had been leftto die on the wharf at Quebec. The captain bundled her out, nobodywould touch her, let alone give her shelter, and the poor sick crathurafore sundown found rest and is now where those who despised her willhave little chance of going.”I asked Father Malloy about his visit to the ship the day before. Hetold me the man who shouted for him had a brother dying, who wanted thechurch’s last rites. “It was my first visit to a fever-stricken ship,”he went on to say, “and it was a revelation. I could not stand uprightin her hold, for it was not much over 5 feet high, and there was littlemore elbow than head room. Every side was lined with berths and I sawdead lying in them with the living. The stench made one gasp, and thesight of the vermin crawling over dead and living made my flesh creep.An Irish priest is used to the sights of disease and want, but theemigrant-ship, fever-stricken, embodies every form of wretchedness andmultiplies them a ten-fold.”The quarantine-buildings are huddled together at the upper end of theisland and each we examined during the day. Except the one in whichuncle lay, they are flimsy affairs, a shelter from the heat of thesun and no more, for the boards are shrunken and the roofs leaky. Inone the berths are in double tier, like those of a ship, the resultbeing the patient in the lower berth is made uncomfortable by the oneabove, and he, in turn, from weakness, can neither get out nor into itwithout help, which he seldom gets. Every place is crowded with sick,even the two churches being occupied. The government had prepared for200 sick; already there are nigh a thousand, and many more on the shipswho cannot be landed for want of room. Without regard to age or sexthey are huddled together in the sheds, and left to die or recover. Theattendance was hardly worth speaking of. At long intervals a man orwoman would come round with drink and food, but there was no pretenceat coming for their comfort. We were told by many nobody had been nearthem for hours. We saw the dead lying next the living, for the bodiesare removed only night and morning, and in many cases there were twoand three in a berth. Over all this sad scene, from which hope hadfled, shone the virtues of patience and submission to the divine will.No querulous word was heard, no grumbling; the stricken flock bowedbeneath the rod of affliction with pious resignation. Workmen werebusy building a new shed and there were tents lying round, but all thepreparations were wofully insufficient. Father Malloy agreed with methat the lack of nurses was even worse than the lack of shelter, andthought a supply might be had from the healthy emigrants. I thoughtnot; emigrants in health were too eager to escape after being bound toscenes of horror on shipboard for a month and more. We labored to doour best, and many a pail of water did the father carry from the riverto serve out in cupfuls in the sheds.The weather has been sorely against the sick, rain with high eastwinds, adding to their discomfort. Nearly every day there is a fresharrival of a ship, and not one without sick on board. The wind had beenfrom the east the day before and on the morning of the 25th a wholefleet was seen bearing up the river, of which a dozen had emigrants. AtFather Malloy’s request I spent a day with him going from ship to ship,a boat having been lent him by a friendly captain. The passengers criedwith joy when they saw him and clustered round the holy man, whoseservices in administering the last consolations of the church wereneeded at every step. I spoke with the passengers while he was below,and it was an unvarying tale of starvation on the voyage and cruelusage. I found the passengers on ships that had been lying at anchorover a week to be still starving, for the captains had not increasedthe rations and Dr Douglas said he could not supply provisions from theshore unless authorized by the Canadian government. One of the newarrivals had 13 dead on board. The 40 ships now at anchor, have nigh15,000 emigrants: of these I am sure one-third would not be passed ashealthy. Sailors are at work on shore erecting a sort of shelter withspars and sails, where the ships will leave their healthy to performquarantine, while they go on to Quebec.June 3.--Father Malloy has left with the design of makingrepresentations to the government about the condition of things here.He intended, if his bishop consented, to go direct to Montreal, andspeak to the ministers themselves. The forwarding of emigrants passedas healthy has begun. They are crowded on to the steamers until thereis barely room to move. The reason for this is, the passage money is adollar a-head and the more packed on board, the more profit. Truth totell, this class of emigrants are eager enough to leave, and get awayfrom this place. The meanness of the Canadian government in dealingwith them is shameful. Instead of allowing healthy passengers to go onwith the ship as at first, they are now landed. Being compelled to landand stay here by the government’s orders, it would be reasonable toexpect the government would provide for them. It does not; all it hasdone is to send an agent who offers to sell them provisions at cost.Uncle’s recovery is hopeless; his strength has gone.5.--Poor uncle is dead. He was buried yesterday. Ellen keeps hoveringbetween life and death; she has youth on her side. Poor Bridget is wornto a shadow, waiting on the sick. Being told a ship that came in thisforenoon was from Sligo, I watched a chance to get on board, expectingto find some I knew among her passengers. I found her deck crowded withemigrants, watching the sailors fish up from the hold with boat-hooksthe bodies of those who had died since entering the river. I soonlearned there was bad blood between the crew and passengers, all ofwhom who could do so had left the steerage two days before and livedon deck. The hold had grown so loathsome with the warm weather that itbecame unbearable. The crew resented their living on deck. The captainstood at the poop rail, and proved to be a civil man. He told me hehad done his best for the passengers on the voyage, but the charterershad poorly provisioned the vessel and he could not therefore give themthe rations he wished. For the bad feeling between the sailors andpassengers he could not blame either. Staying on deck the emigrantswere in the sailors’ way, yet he could not order them back to the hold.Three sailors had caught the fever during the week, which incensedtheir comrades against the emigrants. He was to pay the sailors asovereign for each body brought up. I told him of Captain Christian ofthe ship Sisters, who, the week before, when emigrants and sailorsrefused for any money to go into the hold to bring up the dead, wentdown himself and carried them to the deck on his shoulders. I hope hemay live to know that Irishmen are grateful, for he is now down withthe fever. I recognized none of the passengers, for they were from thenorthwest end of Lord Palmerston’s estates. Their poverty was extreme.They had no luggage and many had not rags enough to cover theirnakedness. So haggard and white were they, so vacant their expression,that they looked more like an array of spectres, than of human beings.Coming back, I had painful evidence of the brutal indifference of theauthorities in dealing with the sick. They continue to be brought fromthe ships to the quay in rowboats, and the line of ships being now twomiles long, the journey is a long one, and often fatal in bad weather.A small steamboat for transferring them would be a godsend, but thegovernment does not get one, does not even spend ten shillings toreplace the broken planks of the steps on the quay, although the wantof them causes many a feeble one to slip into the river.6.--Dr Douglas exemplifies how a man may be estimable as an individualyet unequal for his duties as an official. He is so obliging andgracious personally that it is unpleasant to find fault with him, yetit is apparent he does not grasp the magnitude of the affliction hehas to deal with and is unable to devise means to meet it. All thesteps taken are ridiculous in their petty nature. I have been toldthat it is not him but the Canadian government that is to blame, thatit will not allow him a free hand in meeting the emergency, doesnot respond to his calls, and warns him to be careful in incurringexpenditure. Probably that is true, but the government is notaccountable for the foolish rules by which the island is governed.There is now a large colony of supposed healthy emigrants confined tothe northwest corner of the island. When one falls sick, instead ofbeing taken to the fever-sheds, he is conveyed to the ship in whichhe was a passenger, and from her is taken to the sheds. The delay andthe fatigue of the journey by land and water, if it does not kill thepatient makes his recovery more doubtful. Although the population ofthe island has doubled in a few weeks, the boat with supplies fromQuebec continues to come once a week only. We may be starving, manyare starving this day, yet until the steamer comes there is no help.The dead are being buried in trenches, three tier deep. Men and womenwhose strong arms would add to Canada’s wealth are being held here byits authorities to die of want when within sight of plenty. I look atthe row of farm-houses on the opposite bank of the river, on the littletown whose roofs I see, and knowing there is comfort and plenty overthere, marvel at the stupidity, the criminal disregard, that leaves uswithout bread to eat or even straw to die upon. Steamers pass daily butthey are not allowed to stop at the island; my poor people are keptprisoners to perish amid the rocks of this island. The Almighty willsurely have a day of reckoning with the rulers of Canada, for it isCanada’s territory we are on and it is Canada’s quarantine in which welie bound. The sick are everywhere and are neglected. I found the bodyof a man in a thicket where he had crawled like a scared beast to diein peace. Bodies are taken from the tents daily where the healthy aresupposed to lodge. The sheds have become repugnant to every sense, andthe sick are worse off than on ship, for few have relatives to attendthem, and they lie for hours without being helped even to a drink ofwater. The inmates of a tent told me nobody had been near them for twodays, and not one among them able to stand for a minute. Everythingis against us, for the weather is windy and wet. I go to spend thenight in the old shed. My brain is overburdened with the sorrows of mypeople, and I would I were at rest with Aileen.10.--A steamer came in this morning to take away emigrants, and I amsure over a thousand were packed on board. Her purser brought a packageof letters; one of them was for myself.     Montreal, June 8, 1847.     My Dear Gerald,--I had it in mind to have written you several days     ago, but postponed taking pen in hand day after day in expectation     of being able to convey to you the intelligence that would cheer     your heart--that the government had decided on adopting a policy     of adequate relief. That, it grieves me to say, they have not     done, although I have exerted myself to arouse them to a sense     of their duty, but it is little a poor priest can do with our     public men. When I reached here I went first to see the premier.     After waiting my turn for an hour with a crowd of visitors, I was     admitted. He was civil, but is a dull man, and did not seem to     realize what I was telling him. He told me to go to the provincial     secretary, to whose department emigration belongs, and see him. I     left in no good humor, to do as Mr Sherwood bade me. Mr Daly was     not at his lodgings; he had gone to the back of the mountain to     dine. I have learned since, he is better at dining and wining than     attending to his duties. I had an interview with him next day.     You may not know that Mr Daly is of ourselves. He is a Galway man     himself and his lady is from Kilkenny. Appealing to an Irishman     and a Catholic I expected him to fall in with me--that all I had     to do, was to seize him of the actual facts of the situation at     Grosse isle and he would act with energy. That was what I expected     of him but all I got from him, Gerald, was soft words and     promises, and neither the one nor the other will feed the starving     or cure the sick. He told me to call next day, as he wanted time     to go over the reports. When I went, his servant man said he was     out, and I never found him in again for me. When the house opened,     I managed to get in, to hear what the governor would say about the     emigrants. The words put in his mouth about them made me angry.     The government pretended they had made ample preparation for the     expected influx and that everything was going on well. Beside him     stood two men smiling among a bevy of ladies who knew better,     for I had told them all. In the debate since then, when a member     on the opposition side referred to the rumors of the state of     matters at quarantine, Mr Daly begged the house not to give heed     to alarmist reports and to rest assured the government was doing     everything that was required, had appointed a commission of three     doctors to visit Grosse isle, and would act on their report. I     had little respect before for Canadian politicians, I have less     now. I was advised to wait on the new minister, John A. Macdonald,     the youngest member of the government. I told my friend that if     Mr Daly would not do the decent thing by his countrymen, I was     not going to ask the member for the Orange city of Kingston, who,     like all the others of them, is engrossed in intrigues to keep his     party in office. The talk of the city is whether the ministry     will stand, for its majority is only one or two, and there is a     good deal of excitement about it. More attention is being paid to     the ribaldry of The Pilot than anything else. This will not be for     long. The evil has come to the door of this city. The forwarding     by wholesale of all emigrants able to move, has brought the fever.     The emigration sheds are at Windmill point, an inconvenient place,     for there is not water enough to permit the steamers to come up     to the wharf, and the emigrants have to be landed by scows, which     is sore on the sick. I am not going to say that the journey from     Grosse isle to here is as bad as the voyage across the Atlantic,     but it has a few features worse than it. The steamers come in     with emigrants packed on their lower deck like herrings in a     fish-box. The steamers are chartered by the government from their     supporters, and a few of them are old, worn-out tubs, that take     two days to a trip that ought to be made inside 20 hours. Without     food or cover, blistered by the sun in the day and chilled by the     river breezes at night, the poor creatures are landed here more     dead than alive. Many who went aboard feeling well, are carried     off in a dying state. My curse and the curse of every Irishman be     on the government that allows the helplessness of our countrymen     to be traded upon to make money for their followers. If their     transportation was left open to all ship-owners, the emigrants     would be brought here in large and speedy steamers, and a limit     could be put to the number they carry. Once landed, the emigrants     are decently treated. I am thankful to be able to say that. It     is the city and not the government that manages. For sick and     well there is plenty of wholesome food, and no lack of doctors     or nurses. The food, to be sure, is coarse and the cooking not     good, but you know the saying, The poor drink wather and the rich     sip tay. After Grosse isle it is fine. What I have seen here has     shown me the necessity of moving the quarantine to the flats below     Quebec. If the sick were moved from Grosse isle to near the city     they would get all the supplies and service needed. I expect to     return to Quebec in a day or so, and before leaving here hope     to get the bishop to wait on the premier, to ask that the new     fever sheds be placed on the outskirts of Quebec. I hear from the     emigrants as they arrive of you, and as they speak they bless you.     I hope to see you soon.     YOUR OLD PRECEPTOR.12.--A ship that came in from Sligo has many of my old neighbors. Theysay after we left, the agents gave out that all who refused to emigratewould have the relief taken from them, which was all they had to keeplife in them until next crop. The more that went, the more eager werethose left behind to go. At the rate they are coming, Lord Palmerstonwill have his land clear of people by Michaelmas, and be able to leaseit to Scotch cow-feeders. Most of the emigrants come expecting freeland from the Canadian government and a pound a-head from the agentsof their landlords at Quebec. Oh, the deceivers, to cheat these poorpeople with lies!16.--Bridget is down with the fever, just when Ellen was recovering andlikely to be able soon to leave with her sister for uncle’s farm inHuntingdon. It seems as if exposure, if long enough continued, is sureto induce the disease. Doctor Douglas says few can withstand breathingthe air of the sheds for a fortnight without being laid down. I expectmy turn will come yet. A company of soldiers has arrived to act as aguard over the camp of what is called the healthy emigrants to keepthem from going near the fever sheds. It is of a piece with everythingelse. The fever is in the camp as well as in the sheds. Had they sent afew hundred boards from Quebec to floor the tents, it would have beenmore sensible than to supply a guard. The weather is still wet, and theground under the tents is soaking, yet the people have nowhere else tolie. I was telling the head of the Church of England clergymen, DoctorMountain, of what my friend had said about quarantine being movednear the city. He agreed it ought to be done, although the people ofQuebec would resist. The cellar of the marine hospital having becomefull to overflowing with emigrants, workmen came three days ago toerect sheds on the hospital grounds. The people of St Rochs assembled,scattered the lumber, and drove away the workmen. Lamenting the lack ofnurses, he told me it was partly due to the government’s not offeringsufficient wages. Placards on the Quebec streets asking for nurses at60 cents a day met with no response. Doctors were offered only $3.50 aday. A dollar a day for nurses and $5 for doctors would get a supply,but the authorities would not consent. I can believe anything of them.They will not send us a supply of straw, even, and many of the sick arelying without anything below them.18.--I was witness today of an incident I want to preserve some noteof. I was attending to an old neighbor, Mr Monaghan, who came in theship from Sligo six days ago. He is mending, though still poorly. Whilebending over him, he gave a start, and turning I saw they were carryingin a new patient. They placed him in an adjoining bed. Wasted andsallow as he was, I recognized in him a man I had seen from boyhood,but had never spoken to. He had a farm in our townland and was a bitterOrangeman. With Monaghan he had a feud, which they tried to fight outon many a market day. Stanhope had led a party that beat his oldest sonand four other boys nigh to death one St John’s eve, and had heapedinsult on him and his times without count. I will not say Monaghan didnot pay him back. If he did not, somebody else did, for he had hisstackyard twice burned and one fine morning found four of his cowshoughed. How would these mortal enemies meet now, far from their nativeland and laid side by side in deathly sickness? Stanhope was overcomewith the fatigue of bringing him from the ship, and lay exhausted withhis eyes shut. I held up his head to give him some cordial, and thenhe sank back and fell asleep. I kept my eye on him as I went about theshed, watching his waking. On Dr Mountain’s coming in, I told him ofthe new Protestant patient and of the circumstances I have here setdown. We went to where the couple lay and were looking at them whenStanhope awoke. He gazed helplessly around until his eyes met those ofMonaghan, which had been fixed on him from the time he came in. Theglitter of the old fire sprung up in Stanhope’s eyes and a flush passedover his white face. Neither said a word for quite a while. During thepause the defiant look faded from Stanhope’s face, and I could seerecollection of old neighborhood and a sense of community of sufferingfilled his bosom. The stern, hard features relaxed and a bony hand wasthrust across.“Is that yersilf, Monaghan; will ye shak hans wid me?”“Glad an proud to do that same, and let bygones be bygones, MrStanhope.”There was a moistness in Dr Mountain’s eyes as he said, “Love is thefulfilling of the law. May the Good Shepherd, who has sheep in everyflock, bless you both, and in His own time gather you into His heavenlyfold.”“Amen,” I said with all my heart. “Dr Mountain, I have learnedsomething in this island of horrors--that goodness is not bounded bycreed, for I have seen you and your clergy nurse the sick and feed thehungry day after day although not one in a score of them are of yourchurch. The thanks that have been in my heart for your kindness to mycountrymen I am not ashamed now to speak.”He clasped my hand. “My dear Mr Keegan, say not another word; when aman comes to die the most painful reflection he can have is, that hedid not embrace every opportunity he had during his lifetime of doinggood. You and I have simply done our duty, and, after all, have toconfess we are unprofitable servants of the one God whom we worshipat different altars.” Having said this he turned away to resume hisvisitation of the sick elsewhere.26.--The weather has been steaming hot for a week, with heavy showers,and fog at night, making our situation worse and spreading infection.There is a stench both in and out of doors. Ships continue to comein and the number of sick to grow; a doctor told me there are over2000. The nurses, both men and women, that come from Quebec, are abad lot. They neglect their duties, smuggle in drink to those of thesick who can pay for it, and rob the dying. On this lone island, whereeverything else is so scarce, whisky can be got by whoever wants it.The greed of gain overcomes the fear of infection, and it is smuggledin by small boats from Quebec. Last night there was an uproar in thecamp of the healthy, caused by drunkenness. The military guard is ahurt to the emigrants. Like soldiers everywhere, they have neithermorals nor decency. Bridget grows worse and poor Ellen is making a badrecovery, for she exhausts her strength by trying to nurse her sister.Monaghan and Stanhope talk by the hour, and their converse has put newheart in them. Hope is better than medicine. Indeed, I have seen scoresdie from despondency or indifference to life, who, to all appearance,ought to have recovered. The two old enemies are the most cordial offriends and will soon be able to leave. They have agreed to go withthe survivors of their families to the London district and take upland together. Both are industrious and steady and having buried theirsenseless hatred will be of mutual help to one another. Both have moneyenough to start them.24.--Father Moylan has got back for a few days. There is need for morelike him, but Irish priests are few in this part of Canada, and ourpeople want them alone. The ships now arriving report larger mortalitythan those that came in May. This is due to the heat. The condition ofthe holds of the ships that come in is unspeakably revolting. Severalburied over a hundred in the ocean, equal to a fifth of the number oftheir passengers.July 2.--Father Moylan wanted me to go to Montreal as a witness beforea committee of enquiry appointed by the legislature. I have no heartto leave here, and I told him if they would not believe him they wouldnot believe me. There is no improvement in caring for the sick; thecallousness of the Canadian government to the sufferings of God’s pooron this island I cannot understand. The weather is now settled, andbeyond the sun being scorchingly hot at midday is as fine as could bewished.9th.--This evening I took a walk to the far side of the island andenjoyed the solitude and the peace of nature. Sitting on the beach, Iwatched the sun sink behind the hills. I have a feeling that my ownsun will soon disappear, for I am sad and disheartened beyond all myexperience. Dr Fenwick told me the other day I should leave; thatI needed a change. I cannot, indeed I will not, for I cherish thesecret wish to die where my Aileen left me. A ship has arrived with31 dead on board; she lost over a fourth of those who embarked onher at Liverpool. Another out of 470 emigrants, dropped 150 into theAtlantic. Sure, tragedies like these ought to direct the eyes of thecivilized world to what is happening. My heart is broken at the sightof thousands of my own dear people, men, women, and little children,dying for lack of a crust on Canada’s shore.14.--I think the end has come. Tonight my head throbs and my bones aresore. Bridget, after hovering a long while between life and death,sank to rest this morning, and is buried. Ellen leaves by tomorrow’ssteamer, and will be in Huntingdon in a few days. I gave her a messageto uncle. My life has been a failure. May God have pity on me and onmy poor people. Oh, that Aileen were here; that I felt her hand on myracked forehead.THE END.NOTE TO THE SUMMER OF SORROW.The immigration to Canada in 1847 was the largest on record. Duringthe season of navigation vessels hearing 90,000 arrived in the StLawrence. Of these 20,000 were English, Scotch, and Germans, and onthe vessels that carried them there was no unusual sickness, so that,in considering the calamity of 1847, they are to be set aside, and theremaining seventy thousand alone to be dealt with. They were mainlyIrish Roman Catholics, and it was among them that disease and deathreigned. Fifty thousand of them sailed from ports in Ireland; twentythousand came by way of Liverpool. 129 ships were required to carrythem. On every vessel fever and dysentery broke out; the emigrants whosailed from Liverpool faring worst. In crossing the Atlantic these 129vessels dropped 4092 of their passengers into the deep; while anchoredoff Grosse isle 1190 died on board; out of those they sent ashore uponthe island 3389 perished. A monument in its cemetery records that therewas buried, in less than six months, 5424 persons “who, flying frompestilence and famine in Ireland, found in America but a grave.” That,however, is only a portion of the mortality. Streaming past Grosseisle, after a detention that was harmful to them and of no benefitin protecting the Canadian community against disease, the advancingarmy of immigrants swept westward, and wherever it bivouaced, lefta cluster of graves. At Quebec city 712 died, at Montreal 6330, atLachine 130, at Cornwall 52, at Kingston 1900, at Toronto 863. Onlywhere the authorities prepared places of shelter, was any record keptof the deaths, and these places closed in October. Of the mortalityduring the winter no count was kept nor of the hundreds who diedby twos or threes along the routes of travel or in remote countrydistricts, to which the sorely smitten people penetrated in the hopeof relief. The official record gives the total at 17,000; actually,about 20,000 died. Adding those who died on shipboard, the numberrises to 24,000. That is, out of every fourteen who left Ireland, fivedied--a rate of mortality without parallel in modern times. For thisappalling destruction of human life, the Irish landlords were primarilyresponsible in compelling or inducing their tenants to leave Irelandwithout making adequate provision for their sustenance. For theirtreatment on shipboard, the owners, or charterers of the vessels, andthe officers in command are accountable. It is humiliating to statethat no effort was made by the officials at Quebec to punish thecaptains and mates of vessels who had maltreated passengers. It wasnotorious that the poor emigrant had been robbed in measuring out hisscanty allowance of biscuit, meal, and water, and that the qualitywas detestable, yet there is only one case on record of a captainbeing brought to account. The master of the Birnam was charged withcheating in the allowance of water. By confessing judgment and payinga paltry fine, he avoided trial and went free! No class of men moreabuse the power their position gives them than the officers of ships.The emigrant has always been badly treated; is to this day shamefullyused. Steam has shortened the voyage and made it more bearable, whilegovernment requirements as to space and accommodation are more liberal,but there are steamships which come to Quebec whose passengers tellof their voyage being an ordeal of starvation and neglect--of pettytyranny on the part of hectoring ship-officers, of food being thrownbefore them of such execrable quality and so badly cooked as to turnthe stoutest stomach. Desirous of hurrying to their destination andknowing their inability to contend with powerful companies, thegrievances of the poverty-stricken and friendless immigrant areunrecorded in our courts.For the tragedy enacted at Grosse isle in 1847, and its sad scenesre-enacted in every town and city west of it, from Quebec to Sandwich,the Canadian government is accountable, and the responsibility for thedeath of the twenty thousand laid in premature graves lies at the doorof Sherwood and his ministers. The letters and reports of Dr Douglasshow they were fully acquainted with the awful state of affairs atGrosse isle from the landing of the first sick emigrants, yet tookno adequate steps in response. There never was a calamity that couldhave been more easily averted; there never was waste of life thatcould have been more easily prevented. The British government did itspart. Communication was slow then, and it was past the middle of Junebefore accounts of the dreadful state of matters at Grosse isle reachedBritain. On the 18th, the Imperial government sent a despatch askingthe Canadian authorities to take vigorous action to relieve it andpromising to pay the cost. On receipt of this despatch, the Canadiangovernment became lavish enough, and the following year presented abill for some $700,000, which the Imperial authorities paid withoutenquiry. Where that money went, it is useless now to enquire; assuredlylittle of it went to feed the famishing immigrant. The efficiencyof the action of the government can be judged by one fact--it wasnot until the end of August it had provided sufficient sheds for thesick at Grosse isle to permit of the sexes being separated. Whileno Canadian can look back upon 1847 without a feeling of shame forthe conduct of our public men, they entertain an honest pride in thedevotion of the clergy and physicians. Thus, out of 42 Roman Catholicpriests who volunteered to visit Grosse isle 19 caught the fever, and4 died. Out of the 16 Episcopal clergymen who responded to the call ofBishop Mountain, 7 took ill and 2 died. Of the 26 doctors, 22 fell illand 4 died. The same devotion was shown elsewhere, doctors, nurses, andministers, in the hope of doing good to the sick and dying, walkinginto danger. One clergyman associated with this district, Rev Wm.Dawes, died from the fever at St Johns. The mayor of Montreal, J. T.Mills, after doing invaluable work in providing for the sick, caughtthe contagion and died.*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GLEANER TALES ***Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in theUnited States without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tmProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution ofelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety ofcomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. Itexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donationsfrom people in all walks of life.Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with theassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm'sgoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection willremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the ProjectGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secureand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and futuregenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, seeSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page atwww.gutenberg.orgSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive FoundationThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of thestate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the InternalRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identificationnumber is 64-6221541.

Email contact links and upto date contact information can be found at the Foundation's websiteand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contactSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project GutenbergLiterary Archive FoundationProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive withoutwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission ofincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can befreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widestarray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exemptstatus with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulatingcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the UnitedStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SENDDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particularstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donateWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donationmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of otherways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. Todonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donateSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic worksProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the ProjectGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could befreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced anddistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network ofvolunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright inthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do notnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paperedition.Most people start at our website which has the main PG searchfacility: www.gutenberg.orgThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
