MILTON AND MALATESTI.

About nine years after Milton visited Italy, he thus briefly noticed, in
letter to Carlo Dati, his surviving Florentine friends:

    "Carolo DATO patricio Florentino.... Tu interim, mi Carole,
    valebis, et Cultellino, Francino, Frescobaldo, Malatestæ,
    Clementillo minori, et si quem alium nostri amantiorem novisti;
    toti denique Gaddianæ academiæ, salutem meo nomine plurimam
    dices. Interim vale.--_Londino_, Aprilis 21. 1647."

The above extract is from _The prose works of John Milton_, as printed
in 1806, and I shall add to it the translation by Robert Fellowes, A.M.,
from the same edition:

    "To Carolo DEODATI, a Florentine noble.... In the mean time,
    my dear Charles, farewell, and present my kind wishes to
    Cultellino, Francisco, Trescobaldo, Malatesto, the younger
    Clemantillo, and every other inquiring friend, and to all the
    members of the Gaddian academy. Adieu.--_London_, April 21.
    1647."

Warton states, in a note on the minor poems of Milton, that Mr. Brand
discovered, on a book-stall, a manuscript of _La tina_ of Malatesti,
_dedicated to Milton while at Florence_, and that he gave it to Mr.
Hollis, who sent it in 1758, together with the works of Milton, to
the Accademia della Crusca. Warton justly observes, "The first piece
would have been a greater curiosity in England." With these facts the
information of the most recent biographers of Milton seems to terminate.
I am enabled, however, to prove that the work is IN PRINT, and shall
transcribe my authority _verbatim_:

    "MALATESTI, _Antonio_. LA TINA, equivoci rusticali (in 50
    sonetti). Londra, Tommaso Edlin, 1757, in 8ᵒ.

    _Non è fatta in Londra quest' ediz. nel 1757, ma presso che 80
    anni dopo in Venezia, ed in numero di 50 esemplari in carta
    velina, due in carta grande inglese da disegno, ed uno, unico,
    in_ PERGAMENA.

    Il Malatesti aveva regalato una copia di questi graziosissimi
    sonetti al celebre inglese Gio. Milton, nell' anno in cui egli
    visitava l'Italia. Dopo la morte del Milton pervennero in mano
    del sig. Brant, gentiluomo inglese, il quale una copia ne
    fece trarre per {238} regalarla a Gio. Marsili, prof. dell'
    Università di Padova, che nel 1757 si trovava in Londra. Il MS.
    del Marsili servì a questa ristampa che porta in fronte quella
    stessa prefazione in inglese che stava nel MS. Marsiliano."

The authority alluded to is the fourth edition of the _Serie dei testi
di lingua_ of Bartolommeo Gamba, Venezia, 1839, royal 8vo.--one of the
best bibliographical compilations ever produced. I was led to suspect, on
glancing at the note, that Gamba himself was the editor of the volume,
and now consider it as certain, for _La tina_ appears under his name in
the index. As copies of the work must have reached England I hope to see
the dedication reprinted, and am sure it would be received as a welcome
curiosity.

I cannot commend Mr. Fellowes as a translator of Milton. _To Carolo_ is
a solecism; _Deodati_ should be _Dati_; the period which precedes the
extract is entirely omitted; and the five names which follow _Charles_,
besides being mis-spelt, have the termination which can only be required
in Latin composition! I believe we should read Coltellini, Francini,
Frescobaldi, Malatesti, and Clementini. On Coltellini and Malatesti there
is much valuable information in Poggiali and Gamba.

"THAT SWINNEY."

(_Continued from_ p. 215.)

Swinney was the devoted servant of all men in power--of all who had
been or were likely to be in power--except, perhaps, the peace-makers,
who, curiously enough, did not please this minister of peace--of all,
perhaps, who subscribed to his publications, or had the means to
subscribe; and who, if they did not, might hereafter. Swinney's volume of
_Fugitive Pieces_ was dedicated to the Duke of Grafton. A third edition
contains additions which show how Swinney's great zeal outran his little
discretion. The following verses appeared originally in _The Public
Advertiser_ on the 27th of May, 1768, and are bad enough to be preserved
as a curiosity:

    _"An Extempore Effusion on reading a Scurrilous Invective
    against the Duke of G----n [Grafton], published in yesterday's
    Newspapers._

    Cursed be the Wretch, and blasted rot his name,
    Who dares to stab an injured G----n's fame!
    Who (while his public virtue stands confest,
    And lives within his ROYAL MASTER'S breast)
    Can rake for Scandal in his private life,
    And widen breaches between man and wife;
    Who casts a stone (like some unthinking Elf),
    That haply shall recoil against himself!
    Anguish, Remorse, and Terror seize his Soul,
    And waste it quick where fiends malicious howl;
    May those rank pests through which his father fell,
    Announce his coming to the Gates of Hell!
    And yet, or ere he plunge into the Lake,
    Where no cool stream his endless thirst can slake,
    May CHRIST in mercy deprecate his doom,
    And may to HIM his promised Kingdom come!

                              "SIDNEY SWINNEY."

Not content with future punishment, the Doctor, in another poem,
threatens present vengeance:

    "But hark thee, wretch; believe him while he swears;
    SID (by the gods) will crop thine asses ears,
    Should thou persist a G----n to impeach,
    And blast those virtues thou canst never reach."

As Draper had taken Granby under his protection, so Swinney must needs
play the chivalrous in defence of Grafton. The dedication of _The Battle
of Minden_ is dated 20th May, 1769, and the poet in the _exordium_ goes
out of his way to notice, as I suppose, the attacks of Junius:

    "His [Sid's] blood recoils with an indignant rage,
    'Gainst the base hirelings of a venal age.
    Wretches! that spare nor ministers nor kings,
    Blend good with bad, profane with sacred things;
    Whose vengeful hearts, with wrath and malice curst,
    Blast virtuous deeds; and then, with envy burst,
    They dart their arrows, innocence traduce,
    And load e'en G----n with their vile abuse."

To this passage he appends the following note, which occupies, in his
magnificent typographical volume, a whole quarto page:

    "It is observable that this amiable personage [the Duke of
    Grafton], and most consummate statesman, has been bespattered
    with as much low calumny and abuse, from various quarters, as
    if he had been the declared enemy of his country, instead of
    having manfully and courageously stood up in support of its
    true interests.--S."

Let us consider now, What are the probabilities of Swinney never having
spoken to Lord George Sackville?

That he did on that occasion speak to Lord George--that he did ask him
"whether or no he was the author of Junius"--may be assumed: and it is
very probable that Junius heard of it, at first or at second hand, from
Swinney himself; for the impertinent blockhead that would ask such a
question, was just the man to tell what he had done, and to think it a
good thing. But had he never before spoken to Sackville? Was this a fact
or a flourish--an affectation of secret information, like the "sent" and
"went" about Garrick--the "every particular next day"--which we now know
to have been untrue.

That Swinney had been chaplain to one of the British regiments serving
in Germany is manifest from twenty different references in the poem and
the notes. I lay no stress on his poetical flights about Euphorbus;
but he speaks repeatedly from personal experience--specially refers to
circumstances occurring when quartered at a farm-house near Embden--at
the camp at Crossdorf--acknowledges personal favours received during the
{239} campaign from General Harvey, and on another occasion attentions
from Granby. Here, for example, is a poetical picture which brings
Swinney vividly before us:

    "At Marienbourn, the vaunting army halts,
    ...
    _A pastor_ from the heav'n-devoted train,
    Brings hams and fowls, and spreads them on the plain:
    The jovial officers their bellies fill,
    _Rally their chaplain_, and applaud him still."

Swinney must therefore have served under Sackville; for, as he tells us,
Sackville

            "by George was made
    Good Marlbro's successor"--

and certainly the probabilities are that he must have been personally
known to--had before spoken to him. Sackville must at this very time have
been particularly anxious about Swinney and his doings, wise or unwise.
That fatal battle of Minden had been the ruin of all his hopes--the
overthrow of all his ambition. In my opinion, Sackville had been
shamefully and shamelessly run down on that occasion; but whether justly
or unjustly stripped of his honours and degraded for his conduct, here
was a man about to write a poem on the battle, to immortalise those who
fought in it; and Sackville must have been keenly alive to what he might
say of him. Swinney foreshadowed what his opinion would be in the First
Book, where he enumerates Sackville amongst his "choice leaders"--

    "Good Marlbro', Sackville, Granby, Waldgrave bold,
    Brudenell and Kingsley."

This was published early in 1769.

In the Second Book Lord George is brought prominently forward. The
"bewilder'd Ferdinand," "doubtful himself," summons a council of war, and
calls first on Sackville for advice.

    "Sackville, disclose the secret of thy breast:
    Say, shall we linger in ignoble rest?
    Shall we retreat? advance, or perish here?
    Resolve our queries: state thy judgment clear."

Sackville now plays the "high heroical," and talks through six pages; but
to what purpose I am unable to conjecture. There _seems_ to be a great
deal of angry remonstrance--of offensive remonstrance:

    "When I ask [says Sackville to Ferdinand], didst ever thou consult
    A chief, till now, and wait the sage result?
    When Aalm's camp was deluged all in rain,
    And floods rusht o'er an undistinguisht plain,
    To thy flint heart remonstrances were vain:
    What, then, avail'd neglected Marlbro's prayers!
    His instances? His unremitted cares?
    The Elector's stables had sufficient room,
    Stalls, without end, anticipate the doom
    Of British chargers, forced to march, at noon,
    Beneath their riders' weight and scorching sun."

Swinney then gives in a note what he calls the genuine queries proposed
by Prince Ferdinand, with Sackville's answer: which answer is nearly
as void of distinct meaning as the poetry, but in favour I think of
risking a battle. The general purport, however, foreshadows what
Swinney's conclusion would have been--that Sackville, the friend of
the British soldier, protested against the frauds by which they were
robbed and starved; protested against their being called on to do all
the work, and run all the risks of the campaign; and disdains to humour
or flatter Prince Ferdinand. These were, in brief, the explanations
given by Sackville's friends as the cause of his disgrace--Granby
the favoured, a gallant soldier indeed, but a mere soldier, being
comparatively indifferent about such commissarial matters, and much more
easily deceived by the cunning of the selfish Germans and English. This
intention is made still more clear in another note, wherein Swinney
states:

    "We may be enabled to account for a certain disgraceful event,
    in some future observation of ours, equally to _the honour
    of the person disgraced_, and to the innocent cause of that
    disgrace."

Under these circumstances there can be little doubt that Sidney
Swinney, D.D., was the party alluded to by Junius; as little, I think,
that Swinney had before, and long before, spoken to Lord George
Sackville,--must have been dear to Sackville, as one of the few who
had served under, and yet had a kind word to say for him,--had said it
indeed, and was about to repeat it emphatically. That Swinney was the
fool Junius asserted, the extract already given must have abundantly
proved; but I will conclude with one other, in which he not only
anticipated Fitzgerald, but anticipated the burlesque exaggerations in
the "Rejected Addresses:"

    "Horse, Foot, Hussars, or ere they march review'd.
    ...
    The Foot, that form the first and second line,
    All smartly drest, like Grecian heroes shine;
    Their bold cock'd hats, their spatterdashers white,
    And glossy shoes, attract his ravish'd sight."

TOM, MYTHIC AND MATERIAL.

"All _Toms_ are alike," quoth the elegant Pelham; and if we were asked
to define the leading idea of him, we should describe a downright honest
John Bull, essentially manly, but withal a bit--perhaps a large bit--of
a dullard. His masculinity is unquestionable. A male cat, as every
body knows, is a _Tom_-cat; a romping boy-like girl is a _Tom_-boy,
or a _Tom_-rig; a large nob-headed pin is a _Tom_-pin; and in many
provincial dialects the great toe is, _par excellence_, the _Tom_-toe.
Last, not {240} least, there is the nectar of St. Giles, the venerable
Old _Tom_. In proof of his stupidity we can adduce a goodly show of
epithets--_Tom_-fool, _Tom_-neddy, _Tom_-noddy, _Tom_-cull, _Tom_-coney,
_Tom_-farthing, &c. We know, indeed, there are people who hold that even
in these instances _Tom_ is merely the masculine prefix to distinguish
the _he_-fool (_i. e._ the _Tom_-fool) from the Molly or _she_-fool of
the ancient mumming. But the race of Toms must not lay this flattering
unction to their souls, for the hypothesis won't stand. The very
monosyllable itself, like "Sammy," has a strong twang of the bauble
in it. An open truth-loving fellow is a _Tom_ Tell-truth; but, on the
other hand, all tinkers--a sadly libelled race of men--are invariably
_Tom_-tinkers, as all tars have been _Jack_-tars from time immemorial.
In some of the old-fashioned country games at cards the knave is called
_Tom_; and the wandering mendicants who used to levy black-mail, under
the plea of insanity, were Mad _Toms_, or "_Toms_-o'-Bedlam." "Tom all
alone" is a northern _sobriquet_ for the Wandering Jew, who, the last
time we heard of him, was caught stealing gingerbread nuts at Richmond
Fair. In the legendary division there is the notorious _Tom_-Styles--the
depredatory _Tom_ the piper's son (legitimate issue of _Tom_ Piper,
the musician of the old Morris Dance)--the fortunate _Tom_ Tidler of
the original diggings, and that heroic little liege of Queen Mab, the
knight of the thumb. _Tom_-Tumbler was a saltatory fiend in the days of
Reginald Scott; and _Tom_ Poker still devours little folks in Suffolk,
without doubt (thinks Forby) a descendant of the Sui.-G. _tompte poecke_,
or house-goblin. As for the ignominious _Tom_ Tiler (North Country for
hen-pecked husband) we cannot allow him to belong to the family; for who
can imagine a hen-pecked Tom! he must have been a wretched individuality,
a suffering, corporeal Tiler.

Tom also bestows his name on divers other things, animate and inanimate.
Among fishes there are _Tommy_-Loach, _Tommy_-Bar, and _Tom_-Toddy
(the Cornish name of the tod-pole). The Long-_Tom_ and the _Tom_-tit
are both ornithological Toms. Tom Tailor is a child's name for the
Harry-long-legs--another singular instance, by the way, of Christian
names applied to animals. _Tom_-trot reminds one of pre-pantaloon orgies,
and is (I think) something in the brandy-ball line. Finally, we may
remark, that a large proportion of her Majesty's subjects are in the
habit of conferring the endearing name upon the staff of life itself.
"Navvies," agricultural labourers, and such like gentry, are accustomed
to divide all human food into two classes, which they euphonically
denominate respectively _Todge_ and _Tommy_; the former comprising
spoon-meat, and the latter all hard food which requires mastication. But
this, we think, is not a case of Tom _per se_, but rather referable to
the Camb.-Brit. _tama_, which has exactly the same acceptation.

SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.

_Shakspearian Parallels._--Searching for Shakspearian parallels, I find
the following, which may leave suggested to our bard his _Seven Ages_.
The first is by Solon, extracted from Clemens Alexandrinus (_Stromat._
vi. p. 685., Paris, 1629), which differs from Philo Judæus (i. p. 25.),
the only two authorities to whom we owe the preservation of this ode, as
also from the text of the critic Brunck and the grammarian Dalzell. An
imitation of the Greek metres is attempted in the paraphrased translation
attached. The second is a sonnet from Tusser, who extends the period of
life beyond seventy, the age of Solon and David in hotter climes, to
eighty-four for hyperboreans, but assigns, with David, the imbecility
belonging to such advanced years.

    7. Παῖς μὲν ἄνηβος ἐὼν ἔτι νήπιος ἕρκος ὀδόντων
          Φύσας, ἐκβάλλει πρῶτον ἐν ἕπτ' ἔτεσιν.

    28. Τῇ δὲ τετάρτῃ πᾶς τις ἐν ἑβδομάδι μέγ' ἄριστος
          Ἰσχὺν, ἥντ' ἄνδρες σήματ' ἔχουσ' ἀρετῆς.

    35. Πέμπτῃ δ' ὥριον ἄνδρα γάμου μεμνημένον εἶναι.
          Καὶ παίδων ζητεῖν εἰς ὀπίσω γενεήν.

_"Contents dies"--Love's Labour's Lost, Act V. Sc. 2._ (Vol. viii., pp.
120. 169.).--I must be permitted, with all due courtesy, to correct MR.
ARROWSMITH'S assertion respecting this phrase; because, from its dogmatic
tone, it is calculated to mislead readers, and perhaps editors. He
maintains that this is a good concord, and pronounces Johnson and Collier
(myself, of course, included) to be "unacquainted with the usage of their
own tongue, and the universal language of thought," for not discerning it.

Now it may, perhaps, surprise MR. ARROWSMITH to be told that he has
proved nothing--that not a single one of his instances is relevant. In
this passage the verb is _neuter_ or _active_; in all of his quotations
it is the verb _substantive_ we meet. Surely one so well versed, as we
must suppose him to be, in general grammar, requires not to be told that
this verb takes the same case after as before it, and that the governing
case often follows. Indeed, he has recognised this principle by giving
"This is the contents thereof" as one of his instances of "contents"
governing a singular verb. Let him then produce an _exact_ parallel to
"contents dies," or even such a structure as this, "the contents _is_
lies and calumnies," and then we may hearken to him. Till that has been
done, my interpretation is the only one that gives sense to the passage
without altering the text.

An exact parallel to the sense in which I take "contents" is found in--

    "But heaven hath a hand in these events,
    To whose high will we bound our calmly _contents_."

                            _Rich. II._, Act V. Sc. 2.

In conclusion, I must add that I still regard this emendatory criticism
as a "game," the Latin _ludus_, as it gives scope to sagacity and
ingenuity, but can rarely hope to arrive at certainty; and it does not,
like questions of ethics or politics, involve important interests,
and should never excite our angry feelings. As to "cogging and
falsification," which MR. A. joins with it, they can have no just
reference to _me_, as I have never descended to the employment of such
artifices.

P. S.--I have just seen H. C. K.'s observation on "clamour your tongues"
in the _Winter's Tale_, and it really seems strange that he should not
have read, or should have forgotten my view of it in "N. & Q.," which is
precisely similar to his own. As to suspecting him of pilfering from me,
nothing is farther from my thoughts.

_Meaning of Delighted._--With reference to the word _delighted_ in
Shakspeare, much discussed in "N. & Q.," may I remind you that we call
that which carries (or is furnished, or provided with) wings, _winged_;
that which carries wheels, _wheeled_; that which carries masts, _masted_;
and so on. Why then should not a pre-Johnsonian writer call that
which carries delight, _delighted_? It appears to me that this will
sufficiently explain "delighted beauty;" and "the delighted spirit" I
would account for in the same way: only remarking that in this case,
the borne delights meant are delights to the bearer; in the other case,
delights to all whom the bearer approaches.

Minor Notes.

_Gray--"The ploughman homeward plods."_--On looking over some MSS. which
I had not seen for years, I met with one of which the following is a copy:

    "A person had a paper folded with this line from Gray marked on
    it--

    'The ploughman homewards plods his weary way.'

    A poetical friend, on looking at the quotation, thought it
    might be expressed in various ways without destroying {242}
    the rhyme, or altering the sense. In a short time he produced
    the following eleven different readings. It is doubtful whether
    another line can be found, the words of which admit of so many
    transpositions, and still retain the original meaning:--

     1. The weary ploughman plods his homeward way.
     2. The weary ploughman homeward plods his way.
     3. The ploughman, weary, plods his homeward way.
     4. The ploughman weary homeward plods his way.
     5. Weary the ploughman plods his homeward way.
     6. Weary the ploughman homeward plods his way.
     7. Homeward the ploughman plods his weary way.
     8. Homeward the ploughman weary plods his way.
     9. Homeward the weary ploughman plods his way.
    10. The homeward ploughman weary plods his way.
    11. The homeward ploughman plods his weary way."

I know not whether this has ever appeared in print. To me it is new, at
least it was, as I now recollect, when I read it several years ago; but
as the exercise is ingenious, I thought I would trespass on "N. & Q."
with it, so that, if not heretofore printed or known, it might be made "a
note of."

_Poetical Tavern Signs._--Passing through Dudley the other day, I jotted
down two signs worthy, I think, of a place in "N. & Q."

No. 1. rejoices in the cognomen of the "Lame Dog" with the following
distich:

    "Step in, my friend, and rest awhile,
    And help the Lame Dog over the style."

No. 2., with a spirited representation of a round of beef, invites her
Majesty's subjects thus:

      Or your stomach out of order,
    Their's sure relief at the 'Round of Beef,'

_"Aquæ in Vinum conversæ. Vidit et erubuit lympha pudica Deum."_--The
interesting note under this title (Vol. vi., p. 358.) refers to
Campbell's _Poets_. The following is an extract from Campbell:

    "Richard Crashaw there [Cambridge] published his Latin poems,
    in one of which is the epigram from a Scripture passage:

    "_Lympha_ pudica Deum vidit et _erubuit_.'"

    Campbell's _Brit. Poets_, ed. 1841, p. 198.

In the _Poemata Anglorum Latina_ is the following epigram on our
Saviour's first miracle at the marriage feast:

    "Unde rubor vestris et non sua purpura lymphis,
    Quæ rosa mirantes tam nova mutat aquas?
    Numen (convivæ) præsens agnoscite numen--
    Vidit et erubuit _nympha_ pudica Deum."

I presume this epigram is Crashaw's poem to which Campbell refers; but
query. Until I saw the note in "N. & Q.," I supposed that the celebrated
line--

    "Lympha pudica Deum vidit et erubuit."

was the happy _ex tempore_ produce of Dryden's early genius, when a
boy, at Westminster School. If the epigram which I have copied is the
original, the last line is surely much improved by the (traditional) line
which Campbell has recorded. Surely _lympha_ is preferable to _nympha_;
and surely the order of the word erubuit ending the line is the best.

_Spurious Edition of Baily's "Annuities"_ (Vol. iv., p. 19.).--In the

stall a few days ago, and found that _the title-page has been changed_.
Those who have reprinted it have chosen the old title-page, which stood
in the work before two volumes were made of it.

_"Illustrium Poetarum Flores."_--On leaving London I thought of bringing

them, I picked up _Illustrium Poetarum Flores per Octavianum Mirandulam
olim Collecti_, &c., Londini, 1651, and brought that little book with
me instead; and, upon looking into it, I find it the worst printed book
I ever saw; and I send you this Note as to it, as a warning against so
disgraceful a publication. Such a work, if well executed and properly
printed, would be a very pleasant companion in a vacation ramble.

_French Jeux d'Esprit._--In the spring of 1852, when Prince Louis

    "Napoleo cupit Imperium, indeque Gallia ridet."

Which translated _mot-à-mot_ gives a clever double sense:

SAMUEL WILSON.

I should be glad of any information respecting Samuel Wilson, Esq., of
Hatton Garden, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, whose will was
proved October 24, 1769, and which I have read. He was the donor of the
bequest, known as "Wilson's Charity," to the Corporation of the {243}
City of London, for loans to poor tradesmen. I wish to ask,--

1. What is known of his origin, family, personal history, &c.?

2. What was his precise degree of relationship to the Halseys, whom he
calls "cousins" in his will? Were they related to the family of that name
at Great Gaddesden, Herts?

3. Did he publish any, and what, letters or books? for he leaves his MSS.
of every kind to his friend Richard Glover, Esq. (the poet I presume),
with full power to collect any letters or papers he may have already
published, and also to arrange and publish any more which he may think
intended or suitable for publication.

4. Is there any published sketch of his life? The only notice I have seen
is the one of a few lines in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, just after his
death.

In compliance with your excellent suggestion (Vol. vii., p. 2.), I send
my address in a stamped envelope for any private communication which may
not interest the general reader.

_The Yew Tree in Village Churchyards._--Why did our forefathers choose
the yew as the inseparable attendant upon the outer state of the churches

help recognising a mysterious embodiment of the spirit of evil as the
intention of the planters. We know that in all mediæval edifices there
is an apparent and discernible endeavour to place in juxta-position the
spirits of good and evil, to _materialise_ the idea of an adversative
spirit, antagonistic to the church's teachings, and hurtful to her
efforts of advancement. I look upon the grotesque cephalic corbels as one
modification of this, and would interpret many equally mysterious emblems
by referring them to the same actuating desire. Now the yew is certainly
the most deadly of indigenous productions, and therefore would be chosen
as the representative of a spirit of destruction, the opposite to one
that giveth life by its teachings, of which the building itself is the
sensible sign. I crave more information from some learned ecclesiologist
on the subject, which is certainly a most interesting one.

_"An" before "u" long._--I should be much obliged to any of my

is the reason of the increasingly prevailing custom of writing _an_
before words beginning with _u_ long, or with diphthongs having the sound
of _u_ long? Surely a written language is perfect in proportion as it
represents the spoken tongue; if so, this is one of the many instances
in which modern fashions are making English orthography still more
inconsistent than it was wont to be. It appears to me just as reasonable
to say "_an youthful_ (pronounced _yoothful_) person," as "_an useful_
(pronounced _yooseful_) person."

If there is a satisfactory reason for the practice, I shall be delighted
to be corrected but, if not, I would fain see the fashion "nipped in the
bud."

_Reversible Names._--Some female names spell backwards and forwards the

a reversible _proprium quod maribus_? No arguments, but instances; no
surnames, which are epicene; no obsolete names, such as _Odo_, of which
it may be suspected that they have died precisely because an attempt was
made to marify them: or say, rather, that Odo, to live masculine, was
obliged to become Otho. Failing instances, I shall maintain that _varium
et mutabile semper femina_ only means that whatever reads backwards and
forwards the same, is always feminine.

suppose that Dr. Sherlock was ordained immediately after taking his
Master's degree, and adds, that 'soon after he became minister of several
small parishes in Ireland, united together, and yielding no more than
80_l._ a year.' The editor has not been able to obtain any particulars of
his ordination, nor the names of the united parishes in Ireland where he
ministered. Canonically, he could not have been ordained earlier than A.
D. 1636."]

_Cardinal Fleury and Bishop Wilson._--There exists a tradition to the
effect that during a war between this country and France, Cardinal Fleury
gave directions to the French cruisers not to molest the Island of Man,
and this out of regard to the character of its apostolic bishop, Wilson.
I should be glad to know whether any and what authority can be assigned
for this story.

WILLIAM DENTON.

[The story rests upon the authority of the Rev. C. Cruttwell, the
bishop's biographer and editor. The following passage occurs in the _Life
of Bishop Wilson_, vol. i. p. 226 of his _Works_, third edition, 8vo.,
1784, and in the folio edition, p. 57.:--"Cardinal Fleury wanted much
to see him [the bishop], and sent over on purpose to inquire after his
health, his age, and the date of his consecration; as they were the two
oldest bishops, and he believed the poorest, in Europe; at the same time
inviting him to France. The Bishop sent the Cardinal an answer, which
gave him so high an opinion of him, that he obtained an order that no
French privateer should ravage the Isle of Man." Feltham, in his _Tour
through the Isle of Man_, 1798, after quoting this story, adds, "And that
the French still respect a Manksman, some recent instances confirm."]

_Dr. Dodd a Dramatist._--I have seen it somewhere stated, that after Dr.
Dodd's trial, he sent for Mr. Woodfall to consult him respecting the
publication of a comedy he had written in his youth, entitled _Sir Roger
de Coverley_, and which he had actually revised and completed while in
Newgate. Was it ever published; and if not, where is the MS.?

[Woodfall's interview with Dr. Dodd at the Old Bailey, is given in
Cooke's _Memoirs of Samuel Foote_, vol. i. p. 195., and is quoted in
Baker's _Biographia Dramatica_, vol. iii. p. 278., edit. 1812. It appears
that Dodd's comedy was commenced in his earlier days, and finished during
his confinement in Newgate; but was neither acted nor printed. In a
pamphlet, entitled _Historical Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the
late Rev. William Dodd_, published anonymously in 1777, but attributed to
Mr. Reed, it is stated at p. 4., that "_Sir Roger de Coverley_ is now in
the hands of Mr. Harris of Covent Garden Theatre."]

[The name Trosachs signifies in Gaelic the _rough_ or _bristled
territory_; a signification perfectly applicable to the confused mass of
abrupt crags which, in some convulsion of nature, has been separated from
the neighbouring mountains of Ben Vennu and Ben An. This glen was first
rendered an object of popular attention by Sir Walter Scott, in his poem
of _The Lady of the Lake_.]

it may be traced to the reverence for the sacred symbol of our faith,
which the early Christian warriors wore depicted on their military
habiliments. Orlando, who bore this emblem on his shield, was called 'Il
Cavaliere del Quartiero;' though it is something singular that he won the
device from Almonte, a _Saracen_ chief.]

JACOB BÖHME, OR BEHMEN.

(Vol. viii., p. 13.)

Some farther particulars respecting the writings of that remarkable
character, who, according to your correspondent, "led astray William Law,
and through him tinctured the religious philosophy of Coleridge, and from
whom Schelling stole the corner-stones of his _Philosophy of Nature_,"
may perhaps interest the readers of "N. & Q."

Who Böhme, or Behmen, was, may be seen by a reference to Francis Okely's
_Memoir_ of him, and to the article in the _Penny Cyclopædia_ (vol. v.
p. 61.) written by Dr. Bialloblotzky; which, with the exception of a
few trifling errors, is carefully compiled. The true character of his
philosophy has been ably and fully described in the later writings of
William Law, especially in his _Animadversions on Dr. Trapp_ (at the end
of _An Appeal to all that Doubt or Disbelieve the Truths of Revelation_);
in _The Way to Divine Knowledge_; _The Spirit of Love_; his _Letters_;
and in the fragment of a _Dialogue_, prefixed to the first of the four
volumes in 4to. of Behmen's _Works_.

Behmen's writings first became generally known in this country by
translations of the most important of them by a gentleman of the name
of Ellistone, and of minor ones by Mr. Humphrey Blunden and others.
Ellistone dying before he had completed the translation of the great work
upon _Genesis_, it was continued by his cousin, John Sparrow, a barrister
in the Temple; who also translated and published the remainder of
Behmen's writings in the English language. Respecting these individuals,
William Law, in a letter written in reply to one received from a Mr.
Stephen Penny, speaks in the following terms:

    "The translators of Jacob Behmen, Ellistone and Sparrow, are
    much to be honoured for their work; they had great piety and
    great abilities, and well apprehended their author, especially
    Ellistone: but the translation is _too much loaded with words_,
    and in many places _the sense is mistaken_.[2]

    "A new translator of Jacob Behmen is not to have it in
    intention to make his author more intelligible by softening
    or refining his language. His style is what it is, strange
    and uncommon; not because he wanted learning and skill in
    words, but because what he saw and conceived was quite new and
    strange, never seen or spoken of before; and therefore if he
    was to put it down in writing, words must be used to signify
    that which they had never done before.

    "If it shall please God that I undertake this work, I shall
    only endeavour to make Jacob Behmen speak as he would have
    spoken, had he wrote in English. Secondly, to guard the reader
    at certain places from wrong apprehensions of his meaning, by
    adding here and there a note, as occasion requires. Thirdly,
    and chiefly, by Prefaces or Introductions to prepare and direct
    the reader in the true use of these writings. This last is most
    of all necessary, and yet would be entirely needless, if the
    reader would but observe Jacob Behmen's own directions. For
    there is not an error, defect, or wrong turn, which the reader
    can fall into, in the use of these books, but is most plainly
    set before him by Jacob Behmen.

    "Many persons of learning in the last century read Jacob Behmen
    with great earnestness; but it was only, as it were, to steal
    from him certain mysteries of Nature, and to run away with the
    philosopher's stone; and yet nowhere could they see the folly
    and impossibility of their attempt so fully shown them, as by
    Jacob Behmen himself."

A well-engraved portrait of John Sparrow may occasionally be met with in
some of the small quarto English treatises of Behmen.

The four-volume edition of Jacob Behmen's _Works_, in large 4to.,
1764-81, is an unsatisfactory performance; having, in fact, nothing
in common with the projected edition by William Law, as expressed in
the above letter. Nevertheless, it has been useful in many respects;
especially as being instrumental in making the productions of Dion.
Andreas Freher more generally known. This edition, moreover, is
incomplete; as several important treatises, besides his Letters, are
entirely omitted. The order, too, in which the pieces are inserted from
the _Book of the Incarnation_ is altogether wrong.

It is a common, but erroneous supposition, that William Law was the
editor of this edition. From his work, _The Way to Divine Knowledge_,
printed some years after the date of the letter quoted {247} above, it
appears that he intended to publish a new and correct translation of
Behmen's _Works_; but did not survive to accomplish it. He died in 1761,
before the first of the four volumes was published; and if he were in
any way identified with it, it could only be by some one or two of his
corrections (found in his own copy of the _Works_ after his decease)
being incorporated therein; but of this there is some uncertainty.
The Symbols, or Emblems, which are stated in the title-page of this
edition to have been "left by Mr. Law," were not his production, but
merely copies of the originals themselves. These were all designed by
the above Dionysius Andreas Freher, a learned German, who had resided
in this country from about the year 1695 till his death in 1728, in
illustration of his own systematic elucidations of the ground and
principles of the central philosophy of Deity and Nature, opened as a new
original, and _final_ revelation from God, in "his chosen instrument,
Behmen." It was, I believe, from Freher, that Francis Lee (see "N. &
Q." Vol. ii., p. 355.) became so deeply versed in the scope and design
of high supersensual and mystical truth. From the year 1740, Freher,
by his writings, demonstrations and diagrams, may be considered the
_closet-tutor_ of William Law at his philosophical retreat at King's
Cliffe, in respect to the great mysteries of Truth and Nature, the origin
and constitution of things, glanced at in what are popularly called Law's
later or mystical writings.

Next to Behmen's _Works_, and coupled with those of Law, Freher's
writings and illustrations must, in regard to theosophical science, be
considered the most valuable and important in existence. Freher also
was personally acquainted with Gichtel, who was deeply imbued with the
philosophy of Jacob Behmen, viz. "_the fundamental opening of all the
powers that work both in Nature and Grace_;" and who, perhaps more than
any other individual, experimentally lived and _fathomed_ it.

Freher's original manuscripts and copies of others (besides those
formerly in the possession of William Law), as well as the manuscripts
of Law and of Francis Lee, and some original documents relating to the
Philadelphian mystic author, Mrs. Jane Lead (Lee's mother-in-law) are
now in the possession of Mr. Christopher Walton, of Ludgate Street; who,
I understand, is on the eve of completing, for private circulation, a
voluminous account of these celebrated individuals. It will also contain,
if I am correctly informed, a representation of the whole nature and
scope of mystical divinity and theosophical science, as apprehensible
from an _orthodox_ evangelical--or, in a word, a _standard_ point of
view; as likewise of the nature and relations of the modern experimental
transcendentalism of Animal Magnetism, with its inductions of the trance
and _clairvoyance_, in respect to the _astral_ as well as _Divine_ magic;
with other similar recondite, but now lost, philosophy. But to return to
Behmen.

The publication of the large edition of his _Works_ in question was
undertaken at the sole expense of Mrs. Hutcheson, one of the two ladies
who were Mr. Law's companions and friends in his retirement at King's
Cliffe, out of respect to his memory; and who furnished the books Mr.
Law left behind him relating to this object. The chief editor was a Mr.
George Ward, assisted by a Mr. Thomas Langcake, two former friends and
admirers of Law; who occasionally superintended his pieces through the
press, being then resident in London. And the reason of this edition not
being completed was, that both Mrs. Hutcheson and Mr. Ward died about the
time of the publication of the fourth volume; Mrs. Gibbon[3], the aunt of
the historian, it appears, not being willing to continue the publication.
All that these parties did as editors was, to take the original
translations, change the phraseology here and there without reference
to the German original (which language it is supposed they did not
understand), omit certain portions of the translator's Prefaces, alter
the capital letters of a few words, and conduct the treatises through the
press.

The literary productions which have commanded the admiration and
approbation of such deep thinkers as Sir Isaac Newton[4], William Law,
Schelling, Hegel, and Coleridge, may perhaps, before long, be thought
worthy of republication. What is required is a well-edited and correct
translation of Behmen's entire _Works_, coupled with {248} those of
Freher, his great illustrator, (including also the Emblems, &c. of
Gichtel's German edition), and preceded by those of Law, which treat upon
the same subject, namely:--1. Answer to Hoadley on the Sacrament of the
Lord's Supper. 2. Christian Regeneration. 3. Animadversions on Dr. Trapp.
4. The Appeal. 5. The Way to Divine Knowledge. 6. The Spirit of Love. 7.
Confutation of Warburton. 8. Letters.

To conclude. The following are the terms in which William Law speaks of
Behmen's writings in one of his letters:

    "Therein is opened the true ground of the unchangeable
    _distinction between God and Nature_, making all nature,
    whether temporal or eternal, its own proof that it is not,
    cannot be, God, but purely and solely the _want_ of God; and
    can be nothing else in itself but a restless painful want, till
    a supernatural God manifests himself in it. This is a doctrine
    which the learned of all ages have known nothing of; not a
    book, ancient or modern, in all our libraries, has so much as
    attempted to open the _ground_ of nature to show its _birth_
    and _state_, and its essential unalterable distinction from
    the one _abyssal supernatural_ God; and how all the glories,
    powers, and perfections of the hidden, unapproachable God, have
    their wonderful manifestation in nature and creature."

And on another occasion:

    "In the Revelation made to this wonderful man, the first
    _beginning_ of _all_ things in eternity is opened; the whole
    state, the _rise_, _workings_, and _progress_ of all Nature
    is revealed; and every doctrine, mystery, and precept of the
    Gospel is found, not to have sprung from any _arbitrary_
    appointment, but to have its _eternal_, _unalterable_ ground
    and reason in Nature. And God appears to save us by the methods
    of the Gospel, because there was no other possible way to save
    us in all the possibility of Nature."

And again:

    "Now, though the difference between God and Nature has always
    been supposed and believed, yet the true ground of such
    distinction, or the _why_, the _how_, and in _what_ they are
    essentially different, and must be so to all eternity, was to
    be found in no books, till the goodness of God, in a way not
    less than that of _miracle_, made a poor illiterate man, in the
    simplicity of a child, to open and relate the deep mysterious
    _ground of all things_."

Thus much upon the "reveries" of our "poor possessed cobbler." It may be
well to add, that Freher's writings (in sequence to those of Law above
named) are all but essential for the proper understanding of Behmen,
especially of his descriptions of the _generation of Nature_, as to its
_seven_ properties, _two_ co-eternal principles, and _three_ constituent
parts: which is the deepest and most difficult point of all others to
apprehend rightly (that is, with intellectual clearness, as well as
sensitively in our own spiritual regeneration), and indeed the key to
every mystery of truth and life.

[Footnote 3: Among the papers of this lady were found, after her decease,
several letters to her from her nephew, Edward Gibbon, the historian,

religious views of the former had, at least from the year 1788, undergone
considerable change. From one of these interesting letters, shortly
to be published, I have been kindly permitted to make the following
extract:--"Whatever you may have been told of my opinions, I can assure
you with truth, that I consider religion as the best guide of youth, and
the best support of old age; that I firmly believe there is less real
happiness in the business and pleasures of the world, than in the life

College, Cambridge) were found many autograph extracts from the _Works_
of Behmen. This is also confirmed in an unpublished letter, now before
me, from Law to Dr. Cheyne in answer to his inquiries on this points. Law
affirms that Newton derived his system of fundamental powers from Behmen;
and that he avoided mentioning Behmen as the originator of his system,
lest it should come into disrepute.]

PASSAGE IN MILTON.

    "And every shepherd tells his tale
    Under the hawthorn, in the dale."

I have read with interest the "Notes" (Vol. i., pp. 286. 316.) on these
lines of the Allegro; because, in spite of early prepossession in favour
of the idea commonly attached to them, I was converted some years ago, by
the late Mr. Constable, R.A., whose close observation of rural scenery
and employments no one can question.

His account of the matter was this:

    "It is usual in Suffolk, and I have seen it often myself, for
    the shepherd, assisted by another man or boy, to make the whole
    flock pass through a gap, in order to facilitate the _tale_.
    One fellow drives them through the opening, by moving about,
    shouting, and clapping his hands, while his comrade, on the
    other side of the hedge, and under cover of a thorn or other
    thick bush, counts them as they leap through. I have not only
    seen but assisted, when a boy, at the shepherd's tale; and I
    do believe Milton had no other idea in his mind. For, indeed,
    the early morning is not the time the poets choose for lovers
    to woo, or maids to listen; and Milton has described a scene
    where all were up and stirring. Neither is the word 'every'
    appropriate, according to the common interpretation of the
    passage; _every_ shepherd would not woo on the same spot; but
    that spot might be particularly favourable for making the tale
    of his sheep."

Your correspondent J. M. M. adduces an argument in favour of the romantic
_versus_ the pastoral, which seems to me entirely devoid of weight. He
thinks that Handel's "'Let no wander' breathes the shepherd's tale of
love." Surely there is more imagination than truth in this. There is a
_series_ of images in the words of that song: it was necessary, unless
the music varied unreasonably to suit them all, to choose a pleasing, but
not very significant, melody, and, above all, to make the close of it a
fit introduction for the "merry bells," and "jocund Rebecs," which burst
in immediately after. I confess I find nothing of the amatory style in
Handel's setting of the two disputed lines. He chose the Pastorale or 6/8
time, as for "He shall feed his flock," "O lovely Peace," &c. But were it
so, I could not admit Handel as an authority, because, as a foreigner,
and an inhabitant of towns, he could not possibly be conversant with the
rural customs of England.

DESIGNED FALSE ENGLISH RHYMES.

(Vol. vii., p. 483.)

I was much surprised to see in your paper such a lengthened defence of
Irish rhymes by a reference to those of English poets, and particularly
to Pope. I thought it was well known that he, at last, became sensible of
the cloying effect of his never-varying melody, and sought to relieve it
by deviations {250} from propriety. This is particularly remarkable in
his Homer, where he has numerous Irish rhymes like "peace" and "race:"
besides "war" and "car;" "far," "dare;" with many other still more
barbarous metres. But all those were by regular design for, if ever poet
"lisped in numbers," it was he; and "the numbers came" at his command.
He introduced those uncouth rhymes to somewhat _roughen_ his too long
continued melody, just as certain discords are allowed in great musical
compositions. It showed good judgment, for they are an agreeable change
by variation. Other English poets too have false rhymes; for even Gray,
in his celebrated Elegy, has "toil" and "smile;" "abode" and "God."

But, with respect to Irish poets, Swift should not have been mentioned at
all because, with perhaps the exception of his "Cadenus and Vanessa," his
poetry was of the doggerel kind; and he purposely used Irish rhymes and
debased English. Thus, in the "Lady's Dressing-room:"

    "Five hours, and who could do it less in?
    By haughty Celia spent in dressing."

Will any one say it was through ignorance that he did not sound the _g_
in dressing? Pope, in his "Eloisa to Abelard," which is sweetness to
excess, concludes with:

    "He best can paint 'em who has felt 'em most."

Why this is a downright vulgarism compared to Swift's open and
undisguised doggerel:

    "_Libertas et natale solum_:
    Fine words! I wonder where you stole 'em."

Leaving Swift out of the question, Irish poets are much more careful
about their rhymes than the English; because they know that what would
be excused or overlooked in them, would be deemed ignorance on their own
parts. I venture to assert, that there are more false rhymes in Pope's
_Iliad_ alone than in all the poems of Goldsmith and Moore together;
though I must again observe that those of Pope were all intentional.

ATTAINMENT OF MAJORITY.

(Vol. viii., p. 198.)

A. E. B. has not quoted quite correctly. He has put two phrases of mine
into Italics, which makes them appear to have special relation to one
another, while the word which _I_ put in Italics, "_ninth_," he has made
to be "9th." Farther, he has left out some words. The latter part should
run thus, the words left out being in brackets:

    "... though he were born [a minute before midnight] on the
    10th, he is of age to execute a settlement at a minute after
    midnight on the morning of the 9th, forty-eight hours all
    but two minutes before he has drawn breath for the space of
    twenty-one years."

Had the quotation been correct, it would have been better seen that I
no more make the day of majority begin a minute after midnight, than I
make the day of birth end a minute before midnight. A second, or even the
tenth of a second, would have done as well.

The _old reckoning_, of which I was speaking, was the reckoning which
rejects fractions; and the matter in question was the _day_. For my
illustration, any beginning of the day would have done as well as any
other; on this I must refer to the paper itself. Nevertheless, I was
correct in implying that the day by which age is reckoned begins at
midnight and I believe it began at midnight in the time of Ben Jonson.
The law recognised two kinds of days;--the natural day of twenty-four
hours, the artificial day from sunrise to sunset. The birthday, and with
it the day of majority, would needs be the natural day; for otherwise a
child not born by daylight would have no birthday at all. I cannot make
out that the law ever recognised a day of twenty-four hours beginning
at any hour except midnight. For payment of rent, the artificial day
was recognised, and the tenant was required to tender at such time
before sunset as would leave the landlord time to count the money by
daylight; a reasonable provision, when we think upon the vast number of
different coins which were legal tender. But even here it seems to have
been held that though the landlord might enter at sunset, the forfeiture
could not be enforced if the rent were paid before midnight. A legal
friend suggested to me that perhaps Ben Jonson had more experience of
the terminus of the day as between landlord and tenant, than of that
which emancipates a minor. This would not have struck me: but a lawyer
views man simply as the agent or patient in distress, ejectment, _quo
warranto_, &c.

A. E. B. twice makes the question refer to _usage_, whereas I was
describing _law_. If I were as well up in the drama as I should like to
be, I might perhaps find a modern plot which turns upon a minor coming of
age, in which the first day of majority is what is commonly called the
_birthday_, instead of, as it ought to be, the day before. Writers of
fiction have in all times had fictitious law. If we took decisions from
the novelists of our own day, we should learn, among other things, that
married women can in all circumstances make valid wills, and that the
destruction of the parchment and ink which compose the material of a deed
is also the destruction of all power to claim under it.

Singularly enough, this is the second case in which my paper on reckoning
has been both misquoted and misapprehended in "N. & Q." My knowledge of
the existence of this periodical began with a copy of No. 7. (containing
p. 107., Vol. i.), forwarded to me by the courtesy of the Editor, on
{251} account of a Query signed (not A. E. B. but) B., affirming that I
had "discovered a flaw in the great Johnson!" Now it happened that the
flaw was described, even in B.'s own quotation from me, as "certainly not
Johnson's mistake, for he was a clear-headed arithmetician." B. gave me
half a year to answer; and then, no answer appearing, privately forwarded
the printed Query, with a request to know whether the readers of "N. &
Q." were not of a class sufficiently intelligent to appreciate a defence
from me. The fact was, that I thought them too intelligent to need it,
after the correction (by B. himself, in p. 127.) of the misquotation.
It is not in letters as in law, that Judgment must be signed for the
plaintiff if the defendant do not appear. There is also an anonymous
octavo tract, mostly directed, or at least (so far as I have read) much
directed, against the arguments of the same article, and containing,
misapprehensions of a similar kind. That my unfortunate article should be
so misunderstood in three distinct quarters, is, I am afraid, sufficient
presumption against its clearness; and shows me that _obscures fio_ is,
as much as ever, the attendant of _brevis esse laboro_: but I am still
fully persuaded of the truth of the conclusions.

LADY PERCY, WIFE OF HOTSPUR (DAUGHTER OF EDMUND MORTIMER, EARL OF MARCH),
AND JANE SEYMOUR'S ROYAL DESCENT.

(Vol. vii., p. 42. Vol. viii., pp. 104. 184)

The mischief that arises from apparently the most trifling inaccuracy
in a statement of fact is scarcely to be estimated. A mistake is
repeated, multiplied, and perpetuated often to an extent that no after
rectification can thoroughly efface. Blunders even become sacred by
antiquity; and the attempt to correct any misstatement, if it does not
entirely fail through the subsequent destruction of evidence that would
have contained the refutation, is frequently received with a coldness
and suspicion, and can seldom, with every aid from undoubted sources,
be brought to prevail against the more familiar and preconceived
impression. An illustration of this may be seen in the reference made
by your correspondent C. V. to the authority of Dugdale, as overriding
the result of later investigations relative to the issue respectively
of the fifth and seventh Lords Clifford of Westmoreland. The loose and
ill-advised assertion of Miss Strickland, intended as it clearly was to
insinuate a mean origin in Jane Seymour, and to lessen her pretension
to an exalted birth, has fortunately received a most complete and
signal disproof; but a question is now raised, which, if it can be
supported, will suit Miss Strickland's view quite as well as her own
inconclusive statement. I cannot but think that what she wished to say
is, as hinted in the suggestion of C. V., that the claim contended for
cannot be supported through the alleged marriage of a Wentworth with
the descendant of Elizabeth Percy, because Elizabeth, Lady Percy's only
daughter, Lady Elizabeth de Percy, who married John, Lord Clifford, is
by _some_ ancient heralds stated to have left no daughter. This would
have been an intelligible assertion, and not entirely inconsistent with
what may be gathered from peerages, and other works compiled solely upon
the authority of Dugdale; and it is indeed the very point of difficulty
contemplated by your learned correspondent C.V., who if I do not mistake
the signature, is himself an authority entitled to much respect.

Dugdale, Collins, and Nicolas make the intermarriage of Wentworth to have
taken place with a daughter of Roger, fifth Lord Clifford; and Dugdale
and Collins are silent as to any female issue of John, the seventh Lord.
Edmondson (_Baronagium Genealogicum_, vol. iv. p. 364.) adopts the same
conclusion; but no higher authority is cited by any one of the above
writers, upon which to found this statement. On the other hand, both
Collins and Edmondson, in the Wentworth pedigree, show the marriage
of Sir Philip Wentworth, of Nettlested, to have taken place with a
daughter of John, seventh Lord Clifford. Edmondson describes the daughter
as _Elizabeth_; but Collins more accurately calls her _Mary_. Banks
(_Baronage_, vol. ii. p. 90.) gives both statements with an asterisk,
implying a doubt as to which of the two is to be accepted.

The Pembroke MS. contains a summary of the lives of the Veteriponts,
Cliffords, and the Earls of Cumberland, compiled from original documents
and family records for the celebrated Lady Anne Countess Dowager of
Pembroke, daughter and sole heir of George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland,
who died in 1605. This valuable collection gives the most minute
particulars and anecdotes connected with the ancient family of the Lords
Clifford and their descendants, and being a few years anterior in date
to the publication of Dugdale's _Baronage_, the information contained
there is entitled to the greatest possible weight as an original and
independent authority.

In this MS. (a copy of which is in the British Museum, Harl. 6177.)
the descendants of Roger, fifth Lord Clifford, are named, but there is
no mention of any daughter who formed an alliance with a Wentworth.
Afterwards come the issue of the marriage of John, seventh Lord Clifford,
with Elizabeth Percy, the only daughter of Henry Lord Percy, surnamed
Hotspur, son to Henry Earl of Northumberland.

    "This Elizabeth Percy was one of the greatest women of her
    time, both for her birth and her marriages, &c. Their eldest
    son, Thomas de Clifford, succeeded his father both in his lands
    and honours, &c. {252} Henry, their second son, died without
    issue, but is mentioned in the articles of his brother's
    marriage. Mary Clifford, married to Sir Philip Wentworth, Kt.,
    of whom descended the Lords Wentworth that are now living, and
    the Earl of Straffod, and the Earl of Cleveland."

To which of the above statements must we give credit? If Dugdale be
right, there will appear a startling discrepance in the ages of the two
persons who are presumed to have formed the alliance in question; whereas
if the filiation given in the Pembroke MS. is relied upon, their ages
will be quite consistent, and all the other circumstances perfectly in
accordance.

Roger, fifth Lord Clifford, was born and baptized at Brougham on the
20th of July, 7 Edw. III., 1333; his eldest son Thomas, sixth lord, was
born circa 1363, being twenty-six years old at his father's death, which
happened on 13th July, 1389, in the fifty-sixth year of his age. Thomas
Lord Clifford died on 4th of October, 1392, leaving his son and heir John
(seventh Lord Clifford) an infant of about three years old. This lord
married the Lady Elizabeth de Percy circa 1413, and his eldest son was
born on 20th of August, 1414: he died on 13th March, 1422.

The wife of Sir Philip Wentworth, were she a daughter of Roger, fifth
Lord Clifford, must have been born between 1363 and 1389; if a daughter
of John, seventh Lord Clifford, she must have been born between 1414 and
1422.

In my former note, it was shown that the father and mother of Sir Philip
Wentworth were married before June, 1423; that Sir Philip was born circa
1424, and married in 1447; and that his eldest son, Henry Wentworth,
being thirty years of age at his grandmother's death in 1478, must have
been born circa 1448. It is therefore clear, that if his wife, Mary de
Clifford, were a daughter of the fifth Lord Clifford, she could not have
been less than thirty-five years older than her husband, and sixty years
old when her eldest son was born. On the other supposition, she may have
been about the same age with her husband, or perhaps two or three years
only his senior.

Can there then be any longer a doubt that this is a mistake of Dugdale?
The other eminent genealogists, cited by your correspondent, have adopted
the statement without farther investigation and upon no better authority,
and the error has thus become familiarised by constant repetition. Had
the misrepresentation been set right in the first instance, your readers
would have been spared the infliction of this lengthy confutation, Miss
Strickland herself protected from the humiliation of a defeat, "in daring
to dispute a pedigree with King Henry VIII.;" and some of the numerous
living descendants of the Protector Somerset been saved from much concern
at finding a pedigree demolished, through which they had been wont to
cherish the harmless vanity of being allied to the honour of a royal
lineage.

PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.

_Three New Processes by Mr. Lyte._--Will you kindly allow me room in
your pages for the insertion of the following three processes, which may
not, perhaps, be uninteresting to some of your readers? The first is
respecting a very excellent combination with which to excite collodion.
The second is on the subject of a capital developing agent, and, I
believe, a partially new one. The third, a certain improvement in the
production of positives on albumen paper.

To make my collodion, I use the Swedish filtering paper, as recommended
by the Count de Montizon, Mr. Crookes, &c., not so much on account of
its superior properties, as the easier manipulation, and the greater
certainty of obtaining a completely soluble substance. Having obtained a
clear and tolerably thick collodion, take

    Rectified spirits of wine   1 oz.
    Iodide of ammonium         45 grs.
    Bromide of ammonium        12 grs.
    Chloride of ammonium        1 gr.

Iodide of silver, freshly precipitated from the ammoniated nitrate, as
much as the solution thus produced will take up--a small excess, which
will settle at the bottom, will not signify. Nearly the same compound,
one which is equally good, is produced as follows. Take

    Rectified spirits of wine   1 oz.
    Iodide of ammonium         50 grs.
    Bromide of ammonium        12 grs.
    Chloride of silver          5 grs.

Whichever of these two sensitizers is used, take 1½ drachms, and add to
every ounce of the collodion.

Collodion thus prepared is _most_ rapid in its action, giving a deep
negative (with Ross's sixteen guinea lens, and the developing agent
I shall hereafter describe) in ten seconds in clear weather, and
instantaneous positive pictures, which may be afterwards darkened with
the solution of terchloride of gold, in chloride of ammonium. It does
not easily solarize, and, what is best of all, gives the most pleasing
half-tones.

I find it preferable, in taking landscapes, to rather increase the
quantity of the iodide of ammonium, in order to give complete opacity to
the sky; but if the operator pleases, he may produce the most admirable
effect with the above-named proportions, by painting in clouds at the
back of the plate with Indian ink: and this latter plan is preferable, as
the addition of more of the iodide lowers the half-tones.

{253}

If more of the chloride than above specified be added, it will cause the
plate to blacken all over during development, before the extreme lights
are fully brought up.

My developing agent is made as follows. Take

    Distilled water            10 oz.
    Pyrogallic acid             6 grs.
    Formic acid                 1 oz.

The latter is not to be the concentrated acid, but merely the commercial
strength. These, when mixed, form so powerful a developing agent, that
the picture is brought out in its full intensity, almost instantly,
while at the same time all the deep shades are quite unaffected, and the
half-tones come out with a brilliancy I have never seen before.

Another excellent developing agent is composed as follows. Take

    Distilled water            10 oz.
    Sulphuric acid              3 drops.
    Protosulphate of iron       ½ oz.
    Formic acid                 1 oz.

The formic acid is also a most capital addition to the protonitrate
of iron, and either this or the former liquid produce most brilliant
positives leaving a fine coating of white dead silver. I may also make
mention of the improvement I have made in the albumen paper, which
consists in the introduction of the chloride of barium into the albumen,
in place of chloride of ammonium or chloride of sodium. Take

    Water                        6 oz.
    Albumen                      6 oz.
    Chloride of barium          7¼ dr.

Whip these up, till they are converted entirely into a white froth; when
this has settled into liquid, pour it into a tall jar, and allow the
precipitate, which will then separate, to settle completely, and strain
the supernatant liquid through fine muslin. The paper, being laid on the
surface of this fluid for a space of from five to ten minutes, may be
taken off and hung up by a crooked pin to dry, and then ironed. It is to
be sensitized with nitrate of silver, 120 grains to the ounce of water.
The setting liquid I use is prepared according to the formula given by me
in Vol. vii., p. 534. of your journal, except that I prefer to use half
to one grain of pyrogallic acid, and 120 grains of chloride of silver.
This paper must be soaked for a few minutes or so in rain water, after
being printed, before being placed in the hypo.; the presence in the
water of any salt seems to destroy the tone of this paper.

_Muller's Processes--Sisson's Developing Solution._--I am glad to find
that I have called the attention of your photographic correspondents to
Mr. Muller's process, as detailed in _The Athenæum_ of Nov. 22, 1851,
which seems to have been strangely overlooked and neglected. As your
correspondents have induced you to reprint the article, perhaps you will
also yield to my request, and reprint an article from the same journal of
later date (Jan. 10, 1852) containing another process, more economical
and more sensitive than the other, invented also by Mr. Muller, and the
value of which I have proved. In that, as in the other, there is no
developing agent required. To save time I have copied from my note-book
the article itself, and append it to this communication.

A photographer of several years' standing informs me that my developing
solution produces excellent negatives upon glass, and that he has been
trying it as a bath with success. He writes me:--"I use your developing
solution for negatives only; and by using a very small opening, say about
3/10ths of an inch diameter, single achromatic lens, I have produced
negatives in one minute, which print most beautiful bright positives.
The views I have taken and developed with your solution were without
sunshine, the sky very cloudy, three o'clock p.m. The collodion was
prepared by Messrs. Knight & Son."

Since I received his letter I have tried a negative so developed, with
the best success; and I attribute the success to the fact that you may
go on developing with that solution any length of time almost, without
any fear of spoiling the negative, thus getting thickness of deposit; and
that the deposit on pictures taking so long a time to develop has a very
perceptible yellow tinge, which, like the gold in Professor Maconochie's
method (detailed in _Photographic Journal_ for this month), stops the
chemical rays.

"Plain paper is floated on a bath of acetonitrate of silver, prepared of
25 grs. of nitrate of silver, 1 fluid oz. of water, 60 minims of strong
acetic acid. When well moistened on one side, the paper is removed, and
lightly dried with blotting-paper; it is then placed with the prepared
side downwards on the surface of a bath of hydriodate of iron (8 grs.
of the iodide in 1 oz. of silver). It is not allowed to remain on this
solution, for if this were the case it would become almost insensitive.
The silvered surface must be simply moistened with the hydriodate--the
object being to get a minimum quantity of it diffused equally over the
silvered surface. The photographer accustomed to delicacy of manipulation
will find no difficulty in this. While still wet the paper is placed upon
a glass (face downwards), and exposed in the {254} camera for periods
varying from 10 to 60 seconds, according to circumstances. In sunshine,
and when the object to be copied is bright, 5 seconds in this climate
(India) is sufficient. Excellent portraits are obtained in shade in 30
seconds; 60 seconds is the maximum of exposure. The picture is removed
from the camera and allowed to develop itself spontaneously in the dark,
then soaked in water, and fixed in the usual manner with the hyposulphite
of soda."--_Athenæum_, Jan. 10, 1852.

_Spiked Maces represented in the Windows of the Abbey Church, Great
Malvern._--There is an instrument of this nature described by some
of the martyrologists under the name of "Scorpio," and figured by
Hieronymus Magius (Jerome Maggi) in his treatise _De Equuleo_. It is
there represented as a thick stick, set with iron points, and was used,
together with rods, and the plumbetæ or loaded chain scourges, to torment
the confessors.

I am inclined to think, however, that the weapons represented in the
windows at Great Malvern are intended for morning stars, which were much
employed in arming the watch in the cities of northern Europe in the
Middle Ages, and at a later period as well. This weapon (a variety of
which was called holy-water sprinkle, from the brush-like arrangement of
its spikes) had a long shaft like a halbert, and is often introduced in
paintings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as borne by the
Jewish guard who appear in the various scenes of Our Lord's Passion.

Of course the artists represented their characters as wearing the
dress and provided with arms of their own period; as we see the Roman
soldiers at the foot of the cross in some German and Dutch pictures, mere
portraits of the sworders and swashbucklers of the seventeenth century.

I may mention that a weapon of this coarse description is generally put
into the hands of a ruffian, or at least of some very inferior character.
In _La Mort D'Artur_, Sir Lancelot encounters on a bridge "a passing foul
churl," who disputes his passage, and "lashes at him with a great club,
full of iron pins."

I remember seeing a barbarous weapon taken from a piratical vessel, which
consisted of a massive wooden club, heavily loaded with lead, furnished
with a spike at the smaller end, and thickly studded with iron nails,
tenter hooks, and the hammers of gun locks. This was something like the
old Danish club.

"The Complaint of Poetrie for the death of Liberalitie," 1598, is one of
the pieces, and on the first page of signature C. the word _its_ occurs,

_"Hip, hip, hurrah!"_ (Vol. viii., pp. 20. 185.).--No one, I think, who

doubt that CHEVERELL'S explanation of "hip, hip," is the true one. They
are not _words_, but interjectional _sounds_; with no other meaning than
to prepare for and _time_ the coming "hurrah!" When the men are ready to
cheer, the boatswain's mate gives the signal "hip, hip," and then follows
the general "hurrah!" This practice is adopted in public assemblies
for the same reason--to ensure concert and unity in the final cheer.
"Hurrah!" also I take (_pace_ Sir F. Palgrave) to be a mere _sound_: a
_natural_ exclamation of pleasure, with no more instrinsic meaning than
"Oh!" or "Ah!" for pain, or "Bah!" for contempt. It surely can have no
connexion with the phrase of old Norman law--"clameurs de haro:" for
"haro" is an exclamation of dissent and opposition. "Crier _haro_ sur
quelqu'un," is to excite mischief and scandal against him--the very
reverse of _hurrah_!

ancient manor about one mile south of Wells, called Wellesleigh, which
once, belonged to the Bishops of Bath and Wells. It is certain that a
family called "De Wellsleigh" lived, and held considerable lands in this
manor at a very remote period. In 1253, a Philip de Wellsleigh, and in
1349 another of the same name, are recorded as holding part of the manor
of the Bishops of Bath and Wells. These lands, with the serjeanty and
office of bailiff and "cryer of the hundred," passed into the family of
the Hills of Spaxton, A.D. 1435. In 7 Henry VII., John Stourton held half
a knight's fee in this manor: "formerly held by William de Wellsleigh."
I have an original deed in my possession dated 26th Edward I., being a
feoffment or grant of lands in Dinder (an adjoining parish) by William Le
Fleming, "Dn̄s de Dynder," in which "Thomas de Welesleȝe" and "Robert de
Welesleȝe" (so the name is spelt) are, among others, named as witnesses.
This manor was held by the Bishops of Bath and Wells until the time of
Ralph de Salopia (succeeded A.D. 1329, died A.D. 1363), who gave it to
the vicars choral of the cathedral, by who it has been held down to the
last year (1852), when they sold the fee of it to Robert Charles Tudway,
Esq., M.P. for Wells.

_Penny-come-quick_ (Vol. viii., pp. 8. 113. 184.).--Your correspondents
on the subject of this name do not appear to be aware that there is a
place also so called in Ireland: a small public-house, and one or two
others, on the high road between Wicklow and Arklow, near the sea-shore,
three miles north of the latter town. In Taylor and Skinners Road Maps of
Ireland (1776), it is spelled "Penny-_con_-quick." I have been there, and
do not think that the site countenances H. C. K.'s ingenious etymology.

under sepulchral arches, richly carved in stone: one of them is engraved
in Hollis's _Monuments_. At Burghfield and Barkham, in the same county,
are also wooden effigies of the fourteenth century.

At Hildersham Church, Cambridgeshire, within the altar rails, on the
north side, is a wooden monument of a knight and his lady: the knight
cross-legged, and drawing his sword. They are said to be the effigies of
Sir Thomas Busteler and lady, temp. Edward II.

United Kingdom (called Great Britain) should thenceforth be borne; when
it was also declared that her majesty's motto, "Semper eadem," should be
_continued_.

_Longevity_ (Vol. vii., p. 368. &c.).--Several of the upland parishes
bordering on the river Yare have had remarkable instances of longevity.
One of the best authenticated was a man named Pottle, who resided on the
Reedham estate of the late J. F. Leathes, Esq., of Herringfleet. When
Pottle was 104 years old, the tenantry on the estate subscribed to have
his portrait painted, {256} which they presented to their landlord, each
retaining a lithograph copy of it. Many of these copies I have seen. Two
years after this I conversed with the old man, who was then keeping cows
on a common. There was nothing remarkable about him except his voice,
which was very loud and powerful. He has now been dead some time, but I
do not know his exact age at death.

In the register of burials for the parish of Runham, Norfolk, is this
entry:

    "August 12, 1788. William Russels, aged One hundred and one
    years."

The clergyman has entered the age in round text-hand, evidently that the
entry might not escape notice.

_Green Pots used for drinking from by Members of the Temple_ (Vol. viii.,
p. 171.).--The green pots mentioned in Sir Julius Cæsar's letter had been
introduced into the Inner Temple about thirty years before its date. This
appears from the following passage in Dugdale's _Origines Juridiciales_
(1680), p. 148., where he refers to the register of that Society, fol.
127 _a._:

    "Untill the second year of Q. Eliz. reign, this Society did
    use to drink in Cups of Ashen-Wood (such as are still used in
    the King's Court), but then those were laid aside, and green
    earthen pots introduced, which have ever since continued."

When were these green pots discontinued? Paper Buildings were erected
nearly fifty years before Dugdale's time. The new part built in 1849 was
on the south of these, which may, perhaps, have been the site of the
dust-hole of the Society, and thus become the depositary of the broken
pots mentioned by B.

_Shape of Coffins_ (Vol. viii., p. 104.).--As bearing somewhat upon MR.
ELLACOMBE'S Query, allow me to remark that when travelling a few years
since in the United States, having about an hour's delay in the city
of Rochester, N. Y., I entered one of the churches during a funeral
service. When the ceremony (at which a considerable number of persons
attended) was concluded, the congregation left their seats and walked in
very orderly procession towards the reading-desk, in front of which was
placed the coffin, without any pall or covering. They then slowly walked
round it, in order, as I afterwards found, to take their last look at the
departed. This they were enabled to do without the removal of the lid,
by raising the upper or head portion of it, which was hinged a square
of glass beneath allowing the face to be seen. This strange custom,
which, for my own part, I think would be "more honoured by the breach
than the observance," as the recollection of the living face to me is
far preferable to that of death, I do not remember to have seen noticed
by any of our many travellers in America, though I afterwards found it
to be general. The coffins, which are somewhat differently shaped to
ours, sloping towards the feet, are rarely covered with cloth; but are
generally made of some hard wood such as walnut, highly polished.

_Old Fogies_ (Vol. viii., p. 154.).--There may be too much of even a
good thing, and I wish some of the writers in "N. & Q." would study
compression a little. A short paragraph which I wrote, more in jest than
earnest, on the above phrase, has drawn down on me no less than two
columns from J. L. But this comes of meddling with Scotland.

One might fancy that J. L. was the Irish, not the Scottish advocate, for
he proves the prior claim of Scotland by showing that the word which I
had stated to have been in use in Dublin in the first half of the last
century, was known in Edinburgh in the last half of it. He must also
excuse my saying that he does not seem ever to have studied etymology,
one of the rules of which is, that if a probable origin of a word can be
found in the language to which it belongs, we should not seek elsewhere.
Now _fogie_ (i.e. _folkie_, the Dutch _volkje_) comes as surely from
_folk_, as _lassie_ from _lass_, or any other diminutive from its
primitive. I now have done with the subject.

_Swan-marks_ (Vol. viii., p 62.).--W. COLLYN'S remark on swan-marks may
mislead; therefore it is worth noting that "the swan with two necks" is
not "a corruption of the _private_ mark of the owner of the swans, viz.
two nicks made by cutting the _neck feathers_ close in two places." The
nicks were made in the _beak_; and the privilege of having swan-marks was
by grant from the crown.

The Vintners' Company's mark for their swans on the Thames was two nicks;
hence a two-nicked swan was a very appropriate sign for a tavern. The
royal swans are marked with five nicks, two lengthwise, and three across
the bill (See Hone's {257} _Every-day Book_, 1827, p. 963; Yarrell's
_British Birds_; Jardine's _Nat. Lib._; _Penny Cyclop._, art. "Swan.") It
is to be noted, however, that Hone is in error in saying the two nicks
are the _royal_ swan-mark.

_Limerick, Dublin, and Cork_ (Vol. viii., p. 102.).--I should think
the author of this doggrel couplet, if we are to consider it as a fair
specimen of his poetic genius, may safely be permitted to remain in
obscurity. Be that as it may, the lines are by no means new, nor are
they confined to the sister isle alone. In the _Prophecies of Nixon_,
the Cheshire Merlin, who lived nobody knows when, except that it was
certainly a "long time ago," we are given to understand that:

    "London streets shall run with blood,
      And at last shall sink
    So that it shall be fulfilled,
    That Lincoln was, London is, and York shall be
      The finest city of the three."

As I have just stated, the original date of these _Prophecies_ is
somewhat involved in mystery; but I myself possess copies of three
different editions published during the last century, the first of the
three, purporting to be the sixth edition, bearing date London, 1719.
A Life of Nixon, affixed to this edition, states him to have lived and
prophesied in the reign of King James I.; at whose court, we are farther
told, he was, in conformity with his own prediction, starved to death.
His _Prophecies_ are, by the learned, held to be apocryphal; the country
folk of Cheshire, on the contrary, have as much faith in them and their
author as they have in the fact of their own existence.

_"Could we with ink," &c._ (Vol. viii., pp. 127. 180.).--I am surprised

_Character of the Song of the Nightingale_ (Vol. vii., p. 397.; Vol.
viii., p. 112.).--Although Milton seems to have generally used the
epithet _solemn_ in its classical sense (as cleverly pointed out by MR.
SYDNEY GEDGE), and meant to represent the nightingale as the _customary_
attendant of night, yet there is at least one passage where the epithet
appears to me not to have this meaning; but to express that the song
of the nightingale caused "a holy joy," and was heard not only in the
day-time, but all through the night. For although Milton calls the
nightingale "the night-warbling bird," and so makes it "the customary
attendant of the night," yet he also elsewhere as truly speaks of it as a
_day_ singer. The passage I referred to is in _Paradise Lost_, book vii.,
and seems to me to bear the meaning above spoken of; though MR. GEDGE may
perhaps make "solemn" refer back to the last noun "even." And I confess
that the meaning seems dubious:

    "From branch to branch, the smaller birds with song
    Solac'd the woods, and spread their painted wings
    Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale
    Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays."

I can add one other epithet to the one hundred and nine which I have
already given of the nightingale's song:

    _Wond'ring._ Dryden ("Palamon and Arcite").

I may add, that Otway and Grainger (erroneously printed Graingle) appear
to have used "solemn" in the ordinary meaning of the word.

CUTHBERT BEDE, B.A.

_Adamson's "Lusitania Illustrata"_ (Vol. viii., p. 104.).--Your
correspondent W. M. M. may consult the following works with great
advantage:

    "Résumé de l'Histoire Littéraire du Portugal, suivi du Résumé
    de l'Histoire Littéraire du Brésil, 12mo.: Paris, 1826."

    "Parnaso Lusitano, ou Poesias selectas dos auctores Portuguezos
    antigos e modernos, illustrados cum notas, percedido de una
    Historia abreviada da lingua e poesia Portugueza, tom. v.,
    18mo. Paris, 1826."

The destruction by fire of Mr. Adamson's library, which was so rich in
Portuguese literature, has, with other circumstances, hitherto prevented
the continuation of the _Lusitania Illustrata_; but the appearance
of future parts, in furtherance of the original plan, is by no means
abandoned.

E. H. A.

_Adamsoniana_ (Vol. vii., p. 500.; Vol. viii., p. 135.).--I was aware of
the way in which the famous naturalist spelt his name, but supposed that
Michel Ada_n_son and Michael Ada_m_son were the same, the former being
merely the French mode of writing according to their pronunciation. I was
also aware of the leading events in the naturalist's own career, but was
desirous if possible of identifying his father: "the gentleman who, after
firmly attaching himself to the Stuarts, left Scotland, and entered the
service of the Archbishop of Aix."

Perhaps I may be more fortunate in obtaining some information respecting
another Scot of the same name: James Adamson, for thirty-one years
rector of Tigh, in Rutlandshire, who is described in the inscription
upon his tombstone as "natu Scotus, Anglus vita, moribus antiquis, cum
rege suo in prosperis et adversis." I believe he was the father of John
Adamson, M.A., Rector Of Burton Coggles, in Lincolnshire: the author
of two sermons; one published in 1698, and entitled _The Duty of Daily
frequenting the Public Service_ {258} of the Church; another in 1707,
being the _Funeral Sermon for Sir E. Turnor of Stoke Rochford_[6] (whose
chaplain he was), a great promoter of pious and charitable undertakings.
Can these sermons be now procured? Is anything further known respecting
the author or his family?

_Stanzas in "Childe Harold"_ (Vol. iv. _passim_).--This stanza has
already occupied too many of your pages; will you, however, allow me to
put a ryder on it, by referring your correspondents to Lord Byron's _own_
ignorance of the meaning of an expression in this stanza, expressed in a
letter to Murray, published in Moore's _Life_, Letter 323, dated Venice,
24th September, 1818, when, after pointing out an error in the same
canto, he says:

    "What does 'thy waters _wasted_ them' mean? _That is not me._
    Consult the MS. always."

And in a note by Moore on this letter, he says, "This passage retains
_also_ uncorrected."

At the end of this letter Byron writes, "_I saw the canto by accident._"
Query: If Byron only saw his cantos by "accident," would not a new
edition of his works collated with his MSS. be "a consummation devoutly
to be wished."

_"Well's a fret"_ (Vol. viii., p. 197.).--This is one of a class which
will be lost if not recorded. Forty years ago, in the West of England,
and perhaps elsewhere, a servant, when teased by a child to know where
such a person was, would answer--

                       "In his skin
    When he jumps out, you may jump in."

The answer to _Eh_? was always _Straw_. I dare say more of these things
will be produced. What ought they to be called?

_Tenet or Tenent_ (Vol. vii., p. 205.).--We speak of the _tenets_ of a

title _Mistress_ being given at that period to marriageable young ladies)
was not the _wife_, but the _sister_ of Colonel Barton. Both were the
children of Hannah Smith, Newton's half-sister, and Robert Barton. Mrs.
C. B. was born about 1680.

SOME ACCOUNT of DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE in ENGLAND, from the Conquest
to the end of the Thirteenth Century, with numerous Illustrations of
Existing Remains from Original Drawings. By T. HUDSON TURNER.

"What Horace Walpole attempted, and what Sir Charles Lock Eastlake has
done for oil-painting--elucidated its history and traced its progress
in England by means of the records of expenses and mandates of the
successive Sovereigns of the realm--Mr. Hudson Turner has now achieved
for Domestic Architecture in this country during the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries."--_Architect._

"The writer of the present volume ranks among the most intelligent of the
craft, and a careful perusal of its contents will convince the reader
of the enormous amount of labour bestowed on its minutest details,
as well as the discriminating judgment presiding over the general
arrangement."--_Morning Chronicle._

"The book of which the title is given above is one of the very few
attempts that have been made in this country to treat this interesting
subject in anything more than a superficial manner.

"Mr. Turner exhibits much learning and research, and he has consequently
laid before the reader much interesting information. It is a book that
was wanted, and that affords us some relief from the mass of works on
Ecclesiastical Architecture with which of late years we have been deluged.

"The work is well illustrated throughout with wood-engravings of the
more interesting remains, and will prove a valuable addition to the
antiquary's library."--_Literary Gazette._

"It is as a text-book on the social comforts and condition of the Squires
and Gentry of England during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that
the leading value of Mr. Turner's present publication will be found to
consist.

"Turner's handsomely-printed volume is profusely illustrated with careful
woodcuts of all important existing remains, made from drawings by Mr.
Blore and Mr. Twopeny."--_Athenæum._

THE DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE OF THE MIDDLE AGES. Vol. II.--THE FOURTEENTH
CENTURY. By the Editor of "The Glossary of Architecture."

This volume is issued on the plan adopted by the late Mr. Hudson Turner
in the previous volume: viz., collecting matter relating to Domestic
buildings of the Period, from cotemporary records, and applying the
information so acquired to the existing remains.

Not only does the volume contain much curious information both as to the
buildings and manners and customs of the time, but it is also hoped that
the large collection of careful Engravings of the finest examples will
prove as serviceable to the profession and their employers in building
mansions, as the Glossary was found to be in building churches.

The Text is interspersed throughout with numerous woodcuts.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
