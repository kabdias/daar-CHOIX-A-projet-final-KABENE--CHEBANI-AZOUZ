BACON'S ESSAYS, BY MARKBY.

(_Continued from_ Vol. viii., p. 144.)

Essay XXIX. Of the true Greatness of Kingdoms.--

"The speech of Themistocles."] See Plut. _Them._ 2., _Cimon_, 9.

"Negotiis pares."] An expression of Tacitus. In _Ann._ vi. 39., he says
of Poppæus Sabinus: "Maximis provinciis per quatuor et viginti annos
impositus; nullam ob eximiam artem, sed quod _par negotiis_ neque supra
erat." Again, in _Ann._ xvi. 18. of C. Petronius: "Proconsul Bithyniæ, et
mox consul, vigentem se ac _parem negotiis_ ostendit."

"As Virgil saith, 'It never troubles the wolf how many the sheep be.'"]
Lord Bacon, as Mr. Markby observes, evidently alludes to the following
verses of Eclogue vii.:

    "Hic tantum Boreæ curamus frigora, quantum
    Aut numerum lupus, aut torrentia flumina ripas."

The meaning is, however, doubtless correctly explained by Heyne: "Ut
numerato pecori parcat." "Quia solam considerat lupus prædam," says
Servius. The sense of the passage is, that after the shepherd has "told
his tale," after he has counted his sheep, the wolf does not care how
much he deranges the reckoning.

For the advice of Parmenio to attack Darius by night, and the refusal of
Alexander to steal the victory, see Arrian, _Exp. Alex._ iii. 10.; Plut.
_Alex._ 31., _Curt._ iv. 13.

"Neither is money the sinews of war, as it is trivially said."] "Nervi
belli, pecunia infinita," Cic. _Phil._ v. 2. Machiavel, like Bacon,
questions the truth of this dictum, _Disc._ ii. 10.

"Solon said well to Crœsus (when in ostentation he showed him his gold),
'Sir, if any other come that hath better iron than you, he will be master
of all this gold.'"] This saying is not in Herodotus, or in Plutarch's
Life of Solon. Query, In what ancient author is it to be found?

"Even as you may see in coppice-woods; if you leave your staddles too
thick, you shall never have clean underwood, but shrubs and bushes."]
The same illustration is used by Lord Bacon, in {166} his _History of
Henry VII._: "Like to coppice-woods, that, if you leave in them staddles
too thick, they will run to bushes and briars, and have little clean
underwood" (vol. iii. p. 236., ed. Montagu). The word _staddle_ means an
uncut tree in a coppice, left to grow. Thus Tusser says, "Leave growing
for staddles the likest and best." See Richardson in v., and Nares'
_Glossary_ in _Staddle_, where other meanings of the word are explained.

"The device of King Henry VII."] See Lord Bacon's _History_, ib. p. 234.

"Nay, it seemeth at this instant they [the Spaniards] are sensible of
this want of natives; as by the Pragmatical Sanction, now published,
appeareth."] To what law does Lord Bacon allude?

"Romulus, after his death (as they report or feign), sent a present to
the Romans, that above all they should intend arms, and then they should
prove the greatest empire of the world."] See Livy, i. 16., where Romulus
is described as giving this message to Proculus Julius. A similar message
is reported in Plut. _Rom._ 28.

"No man can by caretaking (as the Scripture saith) add a cubit to his
stature."] See Matt. vi. 27.

Essay XXX. Of Regimen of Health.--See _Antith._, No. 4. vol. viii. p. 355.

Essay XXXI. Of Suspicion.--See _Antith._, No. 45. vol. viii. p. 377.

Essay XXXII. Of Discourse.--

"I knew two noblemen of the west part of England," &c.] Query, Who are
the noblemen referred to?

Essay XXXIII. Of Plantations.--

"When the world was young it begat more children; but now it is old it
begets fewer."] This idea is taken from the ancients. Thus Lucretius:

    "Sed quia finem aliquam pariendi debet habere,
    Destitit, ut mulier spatio defessa vetusto."

                                      V. 823-4.

"Consider likewise, what commodities the soil where the plantation is
doth naturally yield, that they may some way help to defray the charge
of the plantation; so it be not, as was said, to the untimely prejudice
of the main business, _as it hath fared with tobacco in Virginia_."] On
the excessive cultivation of tobacco by the early colonists of Virginia,
see Grahame's _History of North America_, vol. i. p. 67. King James's
objection to tobacco is well known.

"But _moil_ not too much underground."] This old word, for _to toil, to
labour_, has now become provincial.

"In _marish_ and unwholesome grounds."] _Marish_ is here used in its
original sense, as the adjective of _mere_. Spenser and Milton use it as
a substantive; whence the word _marsh_.

"It is the guiltiness of blood of many _commiserable_ persons."] No
instance of the word _commiserable_ is cited in the Dictionaries from any
other writer than Bacon.

Essay XXXIV. Of Riches.--See _Antith._, No. 6. vol. viii. p. 356.

"In sudore vultûs alieni."] Gen. iii. 19.

"The fortune in being the first in an invention, or in a privilege,
doth cause sometimes a wonderful overgrowth in riches, _as it was
with the first sugar-man in the Canaries_."] When was the growth of
sugar introduced into the Canaries? To what does Bacon allude? It does
not appear that sugar is now grown in these islands; at least it is
enumerated among their imports, and not among their exports.

Essay XXXV. Of Prophecies.--

"Henry VI. of England said of Henry VII., when he was a lad and gave
him water, 'This is the lad that shall enjoy the crown for which we
strive.'"] Query, Is this speech reported by any earlier writer?

"When I was in France I heard from one Dr. Pena, that the queen-mother,
who was given to curious arts, caused the king her husband's nativity
to be calculated under a false name, and the astrologer gave a judgment
that he should be killed in a duel; at which the queen laughed, thinking
her husband to be above challenges and duels; but he was slain upon a
course at tilt, the splinters of the staff of Montgomery going in at
his beaver."] The king here alluded to is Henri II., who was killed at
a tournament in 1559; his queen was Catherine de Medici. Bacon's visit
to France was in 1576-9 (_Life_, by Montagu, p. xvi.), during the reign
of Henri III., when Catherine of Medici was queen-mother. Query, Is this
prophecy mentioned in any French writer?

"Octogesimus octavus mirabilis annus." Concerning the prophecy which
contained this verse, see Bayle, _Dict._, art. _Stofler_, note E: art.
_Bruschius_, note E.

Essay XXXVII. Of Masques and Triumphs.--

"The colours that show best by candlelight are white, carnation, and a
kind of sea-water green; and _oes_, or spangs, as they are of no great
cost, so they are of most glory." Mr. Markby says that Montagu and Spiers
take the liberty of altering the word _oes_ to _ouches_. Halliwell, in
his _Dictionary_, explains _oes_ to mean _eyes_, citing one manuscript
example. This would agree tolerably with the sense of the passage before
us. _Ouches_ would mean _jewels_.

Essay XXXVIII. Of Nature in Men.--See _Antith._, No. 10. vol. viii. p.
459.

"Optimus ille _animi_ vindex," &c.] "Ille _fuit_ vindex" in Ovid.

{167}

"Like as it was with Æsop's damsel, turned from a cat to a woman."] See
Babrius, Fab. 32.

"Otherwise they may say, 'Multum incola fuit anima mea.'" Whence are
these words borrowed?

Essay XXXIX. Of Custom and Education.--See _Antith._, No. 10. vol. viii.
p. 359.

"Only superstition is now so well advanced, that men of the first blood
are as firm as butchers by occupation, and votary resolution is made
equipollent to custom, even in matter of blood."] This is an allusion to
the Gunpowder Plot.

"The Indian wives strive to be burnt with the corpse of their husbands."]
The practice of suttee is of great antiquity. See Strabo, xv. 1. § 30.
62.; Val. _Max._ ii. 6. 14.

"The lads of Sparta, of ancient time, were wont to be scourged upon the
altar of Diana, without so much as _queching_."] To _queche_ here means
to _squeak_.

"Late learners cannot so well _take the ply_."] To _take the ply_ is
to bend according to the pressure; to be flexible and docile under
instruction.

Essay XL. Of Fortune.--See _Antith._, No. 11. vol. viii. p. 359.

"Serpens, nisi serpentem comederit, non fit draco."] What is the origin
of this saying?

The character of Cato the elder, cited from Livy, is in xxxix. 40.; but
the words are quoted _memoriter_, and do not agree exactly with the
original.

For the anecdote of Timotheus, see "N. & Q.," Vol. vii., p. 493.

Essay XLII. Of Youth and Age.--See _Antith._, No. 3. vol. viii. p. 355.

"Hermogenes the rhetorician, whose books are exceedingly subtle, who
afterwards waxed stupid."] Hermogenes of Tarsus, who lived in the reign
of Marcus Aurelius, wrote some able rhetorical works while he was still
a young man; but at the age of twenty-five fell into a state of mental
imbecility, from which he never recovered.

"Scipio Africanus, of whom Livy saith in elect, 'Ultima primis
cedebant.'"] The allusion is to Ovid, _Heroid._ ix. 23-4.:

    "Cœpisti melius quam desinis: ultima primis
      Cedunt: dissimiles hic vir et ille puer."

Essay XLIII. Of Beauty.--See _Antith._, No. 2. vol. viii. p. 354.

"A man cannot tell whether Apelles or Albert Durer were the more trifler;
whereof the one would make a personage by geometrical proportions,
the other by taking the best parts out of divers faces to make one
excellent."] With regard to Apelles, Lord Bacon probably alludes to the
story of Zeuxis in Cic. _De Inv._ ii. 1.

"Pulcrorum autumnus pulcher."] Query, What is the source of this
quotation?

Essay XLVI. Of Gardens.--

Many of the names of plants in this Essay require illustration.
_Gennitings_ appear to be broom, from _genista_; _quodlins_ are codlings,
a species of apple; _wardens_ are a species of pear, concerning which
see Hudson's _Domestic Architecture of the Thirteenth Century_, p. 137.
_Bullaces_ are explained by Halliwell to be a small black and tartish
plum, growing wild in some parts of the country.

"My meaning is perceived, that you may have _ver perpetuum_, as the place
affords."] The allusion, probably, is to Virgil, _Georg._ ii. 149.:

    "Hic ver assiduum, atque alienis mensibus æstas."

"Little low hedges, round, like _welts_, with some pretty pyramids, I
like well."] A _welt_ was the turned-over edge of a garment.

"Abeunt studia in mores."] From Ovid's Epistle of Sappho to Phaon, _Ep._
xv. 83.

"Let him study the schoolmen, for they are _cymini sectores_."] The word
κυμινοπρίστης is applied in Aristot., _Eth. Nic._ iv. 3., to a miserly
person; one who saves cheeseparings and candle-ends.

Essay LII. Of Ceremonies and Respects.--See _Antith._, No. 34. vol. viii.
p. 371.

"It doth much add to a man's reputation, and is (as Queen Isabella saith)
like perpetual letters commendatory, to have good forms."] Query, Which
Queen Isabella was the author of this saying?

Essay LIII. Of Praise.--See _Antith._, No. 10. vol. viii. p. 358.

"Pessimum genus inimicorum laudantium."] From Tacit. _Agric._ c. 41.,
where the words are: "Pessimum inimicorum genus, laudantes." _Laudantium_
for _laudantes_ in the text of Bacon is an error.

Essay LIV. Of Vain-glory.--See _Antith._, No. 19. vol. viii. p. 364.

Essay LVI. Of Judicature.--

"Judges ought to remember that their office is _jus dicere_, and not _jus
dare_."] Compare Aph. 44. and 46., in the eighth book _De Augmentis_.

BISHOP BURNET, H. WHARTON, AND SMITH.

The following curious piece of literary history is quoted from pp.
145-147. of Smith's _De Re Nummaria_:

    "But having thus owned the bishop's generosity, I must next
    inform the reader what occasion I have to make some complaint
    of hard usage, partly to myself, but infinitely more to Dr.
    H. Wharton, and that after his decease also. The matter of
    fact lies in this order. After Ant. Harmer had published his
    _Specimen of Errors_ to be found in the Bishop's _History
    of the Reformation_, there was a person that frequented the
    coffee-house where we met daily at Oxon, and who {168}
    afterwards became a prelate in Scotland, that was continually
    running down that History for the errors discovered in it,
    many of which are not very material, and might in so large a
    work have been easily pardoned; and in order to obtain such a
    pardon, I acquainted his Lordship with some more considerable
    errata to be found in the first volume of _Anglia Sacra_, out
    of which I had drawn up as many mistakes as I could possibly
    meet with, and had descanted upon them, as far as I was able,
    in the same method Ant. Harmer had drawn up his, and without
    acquainting the Bishop who was the author, sent them up to his
    Lordship with license, if he thought fitting, to print them.
    But when the collection was made, I had prefixed a letter
    to his Lordship, and next an epistle to the reader. In the
    former it was but fitting to compliment his Lordship, but the
    latter was altogether as large a commendation of Dr. Wharton's
    skill, diligence, and faithfulness in viewing and examining
    the records of our English church history. The disgust that
    this last gave his Lordship obliged him to stifle the whole
    tract; but yet he was pleased to show part of it to many by
    way, as I suppose, of excuse or answer for his own mistakes;
    but as I take it, after the Doctor's decease, he made it an
    occasion of foully bespattering him as a man of no credit, and
    all he had writ in that _Specimen_ was fit to go for nothing;
    which practice of his lordship, after I came to read both
    in the preface and introduction to his third volume, I was
    amazed at his injustice both to the living and the dead. For
    I had acquainted his Lordship that the faults were none of
    Dr. Wharton's own making, who had never seen the MS. itself,
    but only some exscript of it, writ by some raw and illiterate
    person employed by some of his Oxford friends to send him a
    copy of it. I once threatened my Lord Bishop's son that I had
    thoughts of publishing this and some other facts the Bishop had
    used to avoid the discovery of some other errata communicated
    to him by other hands; but I forbore doing so, lest I should
    seem ungrateful for kindnesses done and offered to me."

EARLY PHILADELPHIA DIRECTORIES.

The first Philadelphia Directories were published in the year 1785, when
two appeared: White's and M'Pherson's. The latter is a duodecimo volume
of 164 pages, and contains some things worth making a note of.

Some persons do not seem to have comprehended the object of the inquiries
made of the inhabitants as to their names and occupations; supposing,
perhaps, that they had some connexion with taxation. The answers given by
such are put down in the _Directory_ as the _names_ of the respondents.
Thus:

    "'I won't tell you,' 3. Maiden's Lane."

    "'I won't tell it,' 15. Sugar Alley."

    "'I won't tell you my name,' 160. New Market Street."

    "'I won't have it numbered,' 478. Green Street."

    "'I won't tell my name,' 185. St. John's Street."

    "'I shall not give you my name,' 43. Stamper's Alley."

    "'What you please,' 49. Market Street."

In the _errata_ are the following:

    "For Cross Woman read Cross Widow."

    "For Cox Cats read Cox Cato."

The alphabetical arrangement of a _Directory_ is as great a leveller as
the grave. In the _Directory_ for 1798, after--

    "Dennis, Mr., _Taylor_, Pewter Platter Alley."

appears the following:

    "Dorleans, Messrs., _Merchants_, near 100. South Fourth Street."

These were Louis Philippe and one of his brothers, who lived at the
north-west corner of Fourth and Princes Streets, in a house still
standing, and now numbered 110.

Talleyrand and Volney lived for some time in Philadelphia; but, not being
house-keepers, their names do not appear in any of the Directories.

SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.

_Shakspeare Readings, No. X._--"_Sheer_" versus "_Warwick-sheer_."--At
page 143. of _Notes and Emendations_, Mr. Collier indulges in the
following reverie:--

    "Malone did not know what to make of 'sheer ale,' but supposed
    that it meant _sheering_ or reaping ale, for so reaping is
    called in Warwickshire. What does it mean? It is spelt _sheere_
    in the old copies; and that word begins one line, _Warwick_
    having undoubtedly dropped out at the end of the preceding
    line.... It was formerly not at all unusual to spell 'shire'
    _sheere_; and Sly's 'sheer ale' _thus turns out_ to have been
    Warwickshire ale, which Shakspeare celebrated, and of which he
    had doubtless often partaken at Mrs. Hacket's. We almost wonder
    that, in his local particularity, he did not mention the sign
    of her house," &c.

The meaning of _sheer_ ale was _strong_ ale--that which we now call
"entire"--ale unmixed, unreduced, unmitigated--the antithesis of that
"_small_ ale," for a pot of which poor Sly begged so hard, sinking his
demand at last to "a pot o' the _smallest_ ale." If Christopher lived in
our own times, he might, on common occasions, indulge in _small_; but for
great treats he would have Barclay's entire: and, instead of bullying
Dame Hacket about "sealed quarts," he would perhaps, in these educated
days, be writing to _The Times_ under the signature of "A Thirsty Soul."
Sly evidently was rather proud of underlying a score of fourteenpence for
_sheer_ ale.

Let us hear in what sense old Phil. Holland, in _Precepts of Health_,
uses the word:

    "And verily water (not that onely wherewith _wine is mingled_,
    but also which is drunke betweene whiles, {169} apart by
    itselfe) causeth the wine tempered therewith to doe the lesse
    harme: in regard whereof, a student ought to use himselfe to
    drinke twice or thrice every day a draught of sheere water," &c.

Here "sheere water" is put in apposition to that with which "_wine is
mingled_;" the meaning of _sheer_, therefore, is _integer_: and sheer
milk would be milk before it goes to the pump.

But perhaps it will be objected that sheer, applied to water, as in this
place, may mean clear, bright, free from foulness. Well, then, here is
another example from Fletcher's _Double Marriage_, where Castruccio is
being _tantalised_ after the fashion of the Governor of Barataria:

    "_Cast._ (_tastes._) Why, what is this? Why, Doctor!

    _Doctor._ Wine and water, sir. 'Tis sovereign for your heat:
    you must endure it.

    _Villio._ Most excellent to cool your night-piece, sir!

    _Doctor._ You're of a high and choleric complexion, and must
    have allays.

    _Cast._ Shall I have no SHEER WINE then?"

The step from this to sheer ale is not very difficult.

It may be remarked that, at present, we apply several arbitrary
adjectives, in this sense of sheer, to different liquors. Thus, to
spirits we apply "raw," to wines and brandy "neat," to malt drink "stout"
or "strong;" and then we reduce to "half and half," until at length we
come to the very "small," a term which, like other lowly things, seems to
have been permitted to endure from its very weakness.

"_Clamour your tongues," &c._--

    "Clamour your tongues, and not a word more."

                   _Wint. Tale_, Act IV. Sc. 4.

Notwithstanding the comments upon this word _clamour_, both in the pages
of "N. & Q.," and by the various editors of Shakspeare, I have not yet
seen anything that appears to my mind like a satisfactory elucidation.

Gifford, not being able to make anything of the word, proposed to read
_charm_, which at all events is plausible, though nothing more. Nares
says the word is in use among bell-ringers, though now shortened to
_clam_. Unfortunately the meaning attached to the term by the ringers is
at variance with that of _clamour_ in the text; for to _clam_ the bells
is what we should now call putting them _on sette_ or _setting_ them, and
this is but preparatory to a general crash: still it is possible that the
words may be the same.

MR. ARROWSMITH (Vol. vii., p. 567.) maintains the genuineness of
_clamour_ in preference to _charm_; and, without a word of comment,
quotes two passages from Udall's translation of Erasmus his
_Apothegms_--"oneless hee chaumbreed his tongue," &c.; and again--"did
he refrein or chaumbre the tauntying of his tongue." I confess I cannot
fathom MR. ARROWSMITH'S intention; for the obvious conclusion to be
drawn from these quotations is, that _charm_, and not _clamour_, is an
abbreviation of the older word _chaumbre_.

I am very much inclined to think that the verb in question comes directly
from the A.-S. We find the word _clam_ or _clom_--a bond, that which
holds or retains, a prison; in the latter form the word is frequently
used, and for the use of the former in the same sense Bosworth quotes
Boethius (Rawlinson's ed., Oxon. 1698, p. 152.), which work I am unable
to consult. From these words, then, we have _clommian_, _clæmian_, &c.,
to bind or restrain. It seems not very unlikely that from this original
came Shakspeare's word _clammer_ or _clamour_. I may add that Skinner
explains the word _clum_ by _a note of silence_, quoting "Chaucer in
fab. Molitoris" (I have no copy of Chaucer at this moment within reach);
and in the A.-S. we find _clumian_, to keep close, to press, to mutter,
comprimere, mussitare: all these words probably have the same root.

An instance of the use of the word _clame_ or _clamour_ is to be found
in a work entitled _The Castel of Helthe; gathered and made by Syr
Thomas Elyot, Knight, &c.; printed by Thomas Berthelet_: London, 1539
(black-letter). At p. 52. is the following:

    "Nauigation or rowynge nigh to the lande, in a _clame_ water,
    is expedient for them that haue dropsies, lepries, palseyes,
    called of the vulgar people, takynges, and francies. To be
    carried on a rough water, it is a violent exercise," &c.

_Shakspeare Suggestions_ (Vol. viii., p. 124.).--Icon asks--"Has any one
suggested 'Most busy, when least I do.' The 'it' seems mere surplusage?"

The same suggestion, nearly _verbatim_, even to the curtailment of
the "it," may be found in this present month's number of _Blackwood's
Magazine_, p. 186.

But ICON will also find the same reading, _with an anterior title of
nearly three years_, together with some good reasons for its adoption, in
"N. & Q.," Vol. ii., p. 338. And he may also consult with advantage an
illustrative quotation in Vol. iii., p. 229.

In the original suggestion in "N. & Q.," there is no _presumption of
surplusage_: the word "it" is understood in relation to _labours_; that
word being taken as _a collective singular_, like _contents_, and other
words of the same construction.

The critic in Blackwood disclaims consulting "N. & Q.;" and it is,
no doubt, a convenient disclaimer. He follows the herd of menstrual
Aristarchi, by hailing, with wondering admiration, the substitution of
_ethics_ for _checks_! And he shows his fitness for the task he has
undertaken, by stating {170} that "Mr. Singer _alone_ had the good taste
to print it (ethics) in his text of 1826."

Mr. Halliwell, however, in a recent pamphlet, states that--

    "This _new emendation_ has not only been mentioned in a great
    variety of editions, but _has been introduced into the text by
    no fewer than five editors_, the first, I believe, in point of
    time, being the Rev. J. Rann, who substituted ethics into the
    text as early as 1787."

_Critical Digest._--Your readers have seen no more welcome announcement
than that contained in p. 75. of your present volume, that this project
of a work, bringing into one view the labours of preceding editors and
commentators, is in good hands and likely to be brought to bear. On the
_form_ of such a work it is perhaps premature to offer an observation;
but, to be perfect, it ought to range with that remarkable monument of
a lady's patient industry, Mrs. Cowden Clarke's _Concordance_. On the
_materials_ to be employed, all your readers have such an interest in the
subject as to warrant them in making suggestions; and it will be well to
do so before the plans are fully matured.

It ought, in my opinion, to be more comprehensive than even the largest
scheme suggested by your correspondent; for, in addition to the comments
which may be thought most worthy of insertion in full, or nearly so, it
ought to contain at least a _reference_ to every known comment, in the
slightest degree worthy of notice, in relation to any passage in the
work. To accomplish this would of course be a work of enormous labour,
and the object of the present Note is to suggest, as first step, the
circulation of a list of works intended to be consulted, for the purpose
of inviting additions; not that such a list should encumber the pages
of "N. & Q." but I am much mistaken if you would not afford facilities
for receiving the communications asked for. This course is the more
necessary, inasmuch as, in addition to works written exclusively on the
subject of Shakspeare, there is a vast amount of Shakspearian criticism
spread over works, the titles of which give no indication of the
necessity for consulting them. For instance, upwards of two hundred pages
of Coleridge's _Literary Remains_ are so employed; and though, perhaps,
the work is so well known that it would have found a place in the first
copy of the list I have suggested, it may serve as an illustration of the
sort of information which it would be desirable to invite.

MOTTOS OF THE EMPERORS OF GERMANY.

I was much interested in the lists given in "N. & Q." last year of the
mottos adopted by serjeants-at-law on arriving at that dignity; and it
then occurred to me, that it would be curious to collect in like manner
a complete list of the sentences, which, as is well known to students
of history, the Emperors of Germany were accustomed to assume at their
coronations. A recent visit to Frankfort has given me an opportunity of
making and sending you such a list. The materials are collected from
inscriptions on a series of imperial portraits which adorn the principal
chamber in the Römer or town hall of that city. The list, if it have no
other interest, will at least serve to remind us that some of the Latin

I have added, by way of rendering the catalogue more complete, the name

selected. A glance at these names furnishes a remarkable illustration of
an observation of Sismondi:

    "That the great evil of an elective monarchy, is the continual
    struggle on the part of the rulers to make it hereditary."

It is scarcely necessary to remind your readers, that the integrity
of Charlemagne's empire was preserved until the deposition of Charles
the Fat; that France and Germany did not become separate until after
that event; and that Conrad was, therefore, the first of the German
sovereigns, as he was certainly the first elected by the confederate
princes.

If the accompanying songs have not been printed before, they may perhaps

the cotemporary of Gray and Mason, and well known for his literary and
scientific attainments:

      Where the sportive zephyrs play,
    Whilst in sylvan shades I wander,
      Softly steal the hours away.
    I nor splendor crave nor treasure,
      Calmer joys my bosom knows;
    Smiling days of rural pleasure,
      Peaceful nights of soft repose."

    And bid the magic of thy strain
    To still the throb of wakeful pain;
    That, rapt in the delightful measure,
    Sweet hope again may whisper pleasure,
    And seem the notes of spring to hear,
    Prelusive to a happier year.
    And if thy magic can restore,
    The shade of days that smile no more,
    And softer, sweeter colors give
    To scenes that in remembrance live,
    Be to her pensive heart a friend;
    And whilst the tender shadows blend,

_Green Pots used for drinking from by Members of the Temple._--During
the summer of 1849, when the new part of Paper Buildings in the Temple

up a great number of pots or cups, which are supposed to have been
used for drinking from by the students. I have recently met with the

be interesting to some of your readers:

    "After my hartie commendac'ons, &c. Whereas in tymes past the

    and that you (amongst others) are authorized there in divers
    respects during the vacancye of the said Bishopricke; my

    _It is a vast circumference where none_

And Pascal, in one of his _Pensées_, says:

    "Le monde est une sphère infinie, dont le centre est partout,
    la circonférence nulle part."

Here we have two propositions, which, whether taken separately, or
opposed to each other, would seem to contain nothing but paradox or
contradiction. And yet I believe they are but different modes of
expressing the same thing.

_Fox-hunting._--Can any of your correspondents inform me, when the great
national sport of fox-hunting first came into vogue?

Gervase Markham, whose work on sports, called _Country Contentments, or
the Husbandman's Recreations_, was published in 1654, gives due honour to
stag-hunting, which he describes as "the most princely and royall chase
of all chases." Speaking of hare-hunting, he says, "It is every honest
man's and good man's chase, and which is indeed the freest, readiest, and
most enduring pastime;" but he classes the hunting of the fox and the
badger together, and he describes them as "Chases of a great deal lesse
use or cunning than any of the former, because they are of a much hotter
scent, and as being intituled stinking scents, and not sweet scents."

Although he does admit that this chase may be profitable and pleasant for
the time, insomuch as there are not so many defaults, but a continuing
sport; he concludes, "I will not stand much upon them, because they are
not so much desired as the rest."

_Memorial of Newton._--The subscription now in progress for raising a
statue to Sir Isaac Newton {173} at Grantham, the place of his early
education, recalls to my recollection a memorial of him, about which
I may possibly learn a few particulars from some one of the numerous
readers of "N. & Q."

I remember hearing when a school-boy at the college, Grantham, some
thirty-five years ago, that Newton's name, cut by himself on a stone in
the recess of one of the windows of the school-house, was to be seen
there no long time back; but that the stone, or the portion of it which
contained the name, had been cut out by some mason at a time when the
building was being repaired, and was in the possession of a gentleman
then living in the largest house in Grantham--built, I believe, by
himself. Those of your readers who knew Grantham at the time, will not
need to be told the name of the gentleman to whom I allude. The questions
I would wish to ask are these:

1. Was such a stone to be seen, as described, some forty or fifty years
since?

2. Is it true that it was removed in the way that I have stated?

3. If so, in whose possession is the stone at this present time?

    as the god of riches_. It has the same meaning as Plutus
    among the Greeks. It is not known that the Jews even formally
    worshipped _this idol_, but they used the word to denote
    wealth."

_Derivation of Wellesley._--In a note to the lately published
_Autobiographic Sketches_ of Thomas De Quincey, I find (p. 131.) the
following passage:

    "It had been always known that some relationship existed
    between the Wellesleys and John Wesley. Their names had in fact
    been originally the same; and the Duke of Wellington himself,
    in the earlier part of his career, when sitting in the Irish
    House of Commons, was always known to the Irish journals as
    Captain Wesley. Upon this arose a natural belief, that the
    aristocratic branch of the house had improved the name into
    Wellesley. But the true process of change had been precisely
    the other way. Not Wesley had been expanded into Wellesley,
    but inversely, Wellesley had been contracted by household
    usage into Wesley. The name must have been _Wellesley_ in its
    earliest stage, since it was founded upon a connexion with
    Wells Cathedral."

May I ask what this connexion was, and whence the authority for the
statement? Had the illustrious Duke's adoption of his title from another
town in Somersetshire anything to do with it?

_The Battle of Cruden--A Query for Copenhagen Correspondents._--In the

fought on the Links of Cruden, in the county of Aberdeen, between the

black marble gravestone, about 7 ft. × 3 ft. 6 in., which is said to have
been sent from Denmark as a monument for the grave of his royal highness.
The stone has the appearance of considerable antiquity about it, and
appears to have been inlaid with marble, let into it about half an inch;
the marks of the iron brads, and the lead which secured it, are still
visible.

    "Tradition says it did from Denmark come,
    A monument the king sent for his son."

And it is also stated that, until within the last hundred years, a small
sum of money was annually sent by the Danish government to the minister
of Cruden for keeping the monument in repair. I should be glad to learn
if there are any documents among the royal archives at Copenhagen, which
would invalidate or substantiate the popular tradition.

_Major André._--A subscriber having observed the amount of valuable and
recondite information elicited by a happy Query concerning General Wolfe,
hopes to obtain like success in one he now puts forward in regard to the
personal history, &c. of the unfortunate Major John André, who was hung
by the Americans as a spy during their Revolutionary War. Being engaged
upon a biography of Major André, he has already collected considerable
matter; but wishes to leave no stone unturned in his task, and therefore
begs his brethren of "N. & Q." to publish therein any anecdotes or
copies of any letters or documents concerning that gallant but ill-fated
gentleman. A reference to passages occurring in printed books bearing
on this subject, might also well be given; for there is so little known
about Major André, and that little scattered piecemeal in so many and
various localities, that it is hardly possible some of them should not
have escaped this writer's notice.

ROSICRUCIANS.

(Vol. vii., p. 619.; Vol. viii., p. 106.)

We frequently see Queries made in these pages which could be
satisfactorily answered by turning to the commonest books of
reference, such as Brand, Fosbroke, Hone, the various dictionaries and
encyclopædias, and the standard works on the subjects queried. Now it
seems to me that "N. & Q." is not intended for going over old ground, and
thus becoming a literary treadmill; but its mission lies in supplying
information _not easily found_, and in perfecting, as far as possible,
our standard works and books of reference. MR. TAYLOR'S Query affords an
opportunity for this, as the ordinary sources of information are very
deficient as regards the Rosicrucians.

According to some, the name is derived from their supposed founder,
_Christian Rosencreutz_, who died in 1484. And they account for the
fact of the Rosicrucians not being heard of till 1604, by saying that
Rosencreutz bound his disciples by an oath not to promulgate his
doctrines for 120 years after his death. The mystical derivation of the
name is thus given in the _Encyc. Brit._:--

    "The denomination evidently appears to be derived from the
    science of chemistry. It is not compounded, as many imagine,
    of the two words _rosa_ and _crux_, which signify _rose_ and
    _cross_, but of the latter of these two words and the Latin
    _ros_, which signifies _dew_. Of all natural bodies _dew_ was
    deemed the most powerful dissolvent of gold; and the _cross_
    in the chemical language is equivalent to _light_, because
    the figure of the _cross_ exhibits at the same time the three
    letters of which the word _lux_, light, is compounded. Now
    _lux_ is called by this sect the seed or menstruum of the red
    dragon, or, in other words, gross and corporeal _light_, which,
    when properly digested and modified, produces _gold_. Hence
    it follows, if this etymology be admitted, that a Rosicrucian
    philosopher is one who, by the intervention and assistance
    of the _dew_, seeks for light; or, in other words, the
    philosopher's stone.

    "The true meaning and energy of this denomination did not
    escape the penetration and sagacity of Gassendi, as appears
    by his _Examen Philos. Fludd_, tom. iii. s. 15. p. 261.; and
    it was more fully explained by Renaudot in his _Conférences
    Publiques_, tom. iv. p. 87."

The encyclopædist remarks that at first the title commanded some respect,
as it seemed to be borrowed from _the arms of Luther, which were a cross
placed upon a rose_.

The leading doctrines of the Rosicrucians were borrowed from the Eastern
philosophers[4]; the Christian Platonists, schoolmen, and mystics: mixed
up with others derived from writers on natural history, magic, astrology,
and especially alchemy. All these blended together, and served up in a
professional jargon of studied obscurity, formed the doctrinal system of
these strange philosophers. In this system _the doctrine of elemental
spirits_, and the means of communion and alliance with them, and _the
doctrine of signatures_, are the most prominent points.

Let me refer MR. TAYLOR to Michael Meyer's _Themis Aurea, hoc est de
legibus Fraternitatis Roseæ Crucis_, Col. 1615; the works of Jacob
Behmen, Robt. Fludd, John Heydon, Peter Mormius, Eugene Philalethes; the
works of the Rosicrucian Society, containing seventy-one treatises in
different languages; the Catalogue of Hermetic books by the Abbé Lenglet
du Fresnoi, Paris, 1762; Manget's _Biblioth. Chem. Curios._, Col. 1702, 2
vols. folio; and the _Theatrum Chemicum_, Argent. 1662, 6 vols. 8vo.

I must make particular mention of the two most celebrated of the
Rosicrucian works; the first is _La Chiave del Cabinetto_, Col. 1681,
12mo. The author, Joseph Francis Borri, gives a most systematic account
of the doctrine of the Rosic Cross in this interesting little volume. He
was imprisoned for magic and heresy, and died in his prison at Rome in
1695 at the age of seventy years. On this work was founded one still more
remarkable--

    "Le Compte de Gabalis, ou Entretiens sur les Sciences Secrètes.
    'Quod tanto impendio absconditur etiam solum modo demonstrare,
    destruere est.'--_Tertull._ Sur la Copie imprimée à Paris, chez
    Claude Barbin.--M.DC.LXXI. 12mo., pp. 150."

{176}

This work, thus published anonymously, was from the pen of the Abbé de
Villars. An English translation was published at London in 1714.

The doctrine of the Rosy Cross entered largely into the literature of the
seventeenth century. This applies especially to the masques of James I.
and Charles I. To the same source Shakspeare owes his _Ariel_, and Milton
much of his _Comus_.

It is strange, but instructive, to observe how variously different
minds make use of the same materials. What greater contrast can we have
than _The Rape of the Lock_ and _Undine_?--the one redolent of the
petit-maître and the Cockney; the other a work _sui generis_, of human
conceptions the most exquisite and spirit-fragrant. Wieland's _Idris and
Zenide_, Bulwer's _Zanoni_, and Mackay's _Salamandrine_, are also based
on Rosicrucian principles. Mention of the Rosicrucians occurs in Izaak
Walton's Angler and Butler's _Hudibras_--see Zachary Grey's note and
authorities referred to by him. See also two interesting papers on the
subject in Chambers's _Edinb. Journal_, ed. 1846, vol. vi. pp. 298. 316.

P. S.--I may as well notice here a very curious book of Rosicrucian
emblems, as I have it beside me:

    "Atalanta Fugiens, hoc est, Emblemata Nova de Secretis
    Naturæ Chymica. Accommodata partim oculis et intellectui,
    figuris cupro incisis, adjectisque sententiis, Epigrammatis
    et notis, partim auribus et recreationi animi plus minus 50

    etc.: Oppenheimii, ex Typographia Hieronymi Galleri, sumptibus
    Joh. Theodori de Bry, MDCXVIII." Small 4to. pp. 211.

The title-page is adorned with emblematical figures. The work contains
a portrait of the author, and fifty emblems executed with much spirit.
Amongst others we have a Salamander in the fire, a green lion, a
hermaphrodite, a dragon, &c. Every right page has a motto, an emblem, and
an epigram under the emblem in Latin. The left page gives the same in
German, with the Latin words set to music. After each emblem we have a
"Discursus."

The following remarks on the title occur in the preface:

    "Atalanta Poëtis celebrata est propter fugam, qua omnes procos
    in certamine antevertit, ideoque ipsis victis pro Virgine,
    præmio Victoriæ proposito, mors obtigit, donec ab Hippomene,
    Juvene audaciore et provido, superata et obtenta sit trium
    malorum aureorum per Vices inter currendum objectu, quæ dum
    illa tolleret, præventa est ab eo, metam jam attingente: Hæc
    Atalanta ut fugit, sic una vox musicalis semper fugit ante
    aliam et altera insequitur, ut Hippomenes: In tertia tamen
    stabiliuntur et firmantur, quæ simplex est et unius valoris,
    tanquam malo aureo: Hæc eadem virgo merè chymica est, nempe
    Mercurius philosophicus a sulfure aureo in fuga fixatus et
    retentus, quem si quis sistere noverit, sponsam, quam ambit,
    habebit, sin minus, perditionem suarum rerum est interitum,"
    &c.--Page 9.

    [Footnote 4: The Jewish speculations on the subject of
    elemental spirits and angels (especially those that assumed
    corporeal forms, and united themselves with the daughters
    of men) were largely drawn on by the Rosicrucians. (See the
    famous _Liber Zohar_, Sulzbaci, 1684, fol.; and Philo, _Lib. de
    Gigantibus_. See also Hoornbeek, _Lib. pro Convert. Jud._, Lug.

SEARSON'S POEMS.

(Vol. vii., p. 131.)

John Searson was a merchant in Philadelphia in the year 1766. A few days
before seeing the inquiry respecting him, I came across his advertisement
in the _Pennsylvania Gazette_; but not having made a note of the date, I
have since been unable to find it. His stock was of a very miscellaneous
character, as "Bibles and warming pans," "spelling-books and swords,"
figured in it in juxtaposition. He taught school at one time in Basking
Ridge, New Jersey.

A copy of his poem on "Down Hill" is before me; and it is quite as
curious a production as the volume of poems which he afterwards published.

He describes himself in the title-page as "Late Master of the Free School
in Colerain, and formerly of New York, Merchant." The volume was printed
in 1794 by subscription at Colerain.

The work is introduced by "A Poem, being a Cursory View of Belfast Town,"
thus commencing:

    "With pleasure I view the Town of Belfast,
    Where many dear friends their lots have been cast:
    The Buildings are neat, the Town very clean,
    And Trade very brisk are here to be seen;
    Their Shipping are numerous, as I behold,
    And Merchants thrive here in riches, I'm told."

Here are some farther specimens from this poem:

    "I've walk'd alone, and view'd the _Paper Mill_,
    Its walk, the eye with pleasure fill.
    I've view'd the Mountains that surround BELFAST,
    And find they are romantic to the last.
    ...
    The Church of BELFAST is superb and grand,
    And to the Town an ornament does stand;
    Their Meeting Houses also is so neat,
    The congregation large, fine and complete."

The volume contains a dedication to the Rev. Mr. Josiah Marshall, rector
of Maghera, a preface, a table of contents, and "A Prayer previous to the
Poem."

The whole book is so intensely ridiculous that it is difficult to
select. The following are rather chosen for their brevity than for any
pre-eminent absurdity:

    "The Earl of Bristol here some time do dwell,
    Which after-ages sure of him will tell."

{177}

    "Down Hill's so pleasing to the traveller's sight,
    And th' marine prospect would your heart delight."

    "The rabbit tribe about me run their way,
    Their little all to man becomes a prey.
    The busy creatures trot about and run;
    Some kill them with a net, some with a gun.
    Alas! how little do these creatures know
    For what they feed their young, so careful go.
    The little creatures trot about and sweat,
    Yet for the use of man is all they get."

    "He closed his eyes on ev'ry earthly thing.
    _Angles_ surround his bed: to heaven they bring
    The soul, departed from its earthly clay.
    He died, he died! and calmly pass'd away,
    His children not at home; his widow mourn,
    And all his friends, in tears, seem quite forlorn."

Some of the London booksellers ought to reprint this work as a curiosity
of literature. Some of the subscribers took a number of copies, and one
might be procured for the purpose. The country seats of the largest
subscribers are described in the poem.

The book ends with these lines (added by the "devil" of the
printing-office, no doubt):

    "The above rural, pathetic, and very sublime performance was
    corrected, in every respect, by the author himself."

This is erased with a pen, and these words written below--"Printer's

"FROM THE SUBLIME TO THE RIDICULOUS," ETC.

(Vol. v., p. 100.)

Since my former communication on the use of the phrase "From the sublime
to the ridiculous there is but a step," I have met with some farther
examples of kindred forms of expression, which you may deem worth
inserting in "N. & Q."

Shakspeare has an instance in _Romeo and Juliet_, where he describes
"Love" as--

            "A madness most discreet,
    A choaking gall, and a preserving sweet."

Quarles has it in his _Emblems_, Book iv. Epigram 2.:--

    "Pilgrim, trudge on; what makes thy soul complain?
    Crowns thy complaint; the way to rest is pain:
    The road to resolution lies by doubt;
    The next way home's the farthest way about."

We find it in this couplet in Butler:

    "For discords make the sweetest airs,
    And curses are a kind of prayers."

Rochester has it in the line--

    "An eminent fool must be a man of parts."

It occurs in Junius's remark--

    "Your Majesty may learn hereafter how nearly the slave and the
    tyrant are allied."

and in the following well-known passage in the same writer:

    "He was forced to go through every division, resolution,
    composition, and refinement of political chemistry, before
    he happily arrived at the _caput mortuum_ of vitriol in your
    grace. Flat and insipid in your retired state; but, brought
    into action, you become vitriol again. Such are the extremes
    of alternate indolence or fury which have governed your whole
    administration."

The thought here (be it said in passing) seems to have been adopted from
these lines in Rochester:

    "Wit, like tierce claret, when 't begins to pall,
    Neglected lies, and 's of no use at all;
    But in its full perfection of decay
    Turns vinegar, and comes again in play."

But the most beautiful application of this sentiment that I have met
with, occurs in an essay on "The Uses of Adversity," by Mr. Herman
Hooker, an American writer:--

    "A pious lady, who had lost her husband, was for a time
    inconsolable. She could not think, scarcely could she speak,
    of anything but him. Nothing seemed to take her attention but
    the three promising children he had left her, singing to her
    his presence, his look, his love. But soon these were all
    taken ill, and died within a few days of each other; and now
    the childless mother was calmed even by the greatness of the
    stroke. As the lead that goes quickly down to the ocean's depth
    ruffled its surface less than lighter things, so the blow which
    was strongest did not so much disturb her calm of mind, but
    drove her to its proper trust."

PASSAGE IN THE BURIAL SERVICE.

(Vol. iii., p. 78.)

"In the midst of life we are in death."

A writer in the _Parish Choir_ (vol. iii. p. 140.) gives the following
account of this passage. He says:

    "The passage in question is found in the _Cantarium Sti.
    Galli_, or choir-book of the monks of St. Gall in Switzerland,
    published in 1845, with, however, a slight deviation from the
    text, as we are accustomed to it.

    '_Mediâ Vitâ of St. Notker._

    'Mediâ Vitâ in morte sumus: quem quærimus adjutorem, nisi
    Te Domine, qui pro peccatis nostris justè irasceris. Ad te
    clamaverunt patres nostri, speraverunt, et liberasti eos.
    Sancte Deus: ad te clamaverunt patres nostri, clamaverunt et
    non sunt confusi. Sancte Fortis, ne despicias nos in tempore
    senectutis: cum defecerit virtus nostra, ne derelinquas nos.
    Sancte et misericors Salvator amaræ morti ne tradas nos.'

    "On consulting the _Thesaurus Hymnologicus_ of Daniel (vol.
    ii. p. 329.) I find the following notice. {178} It is called
    'Antiphona pro Peccatis,' or 'de Morte;' and the text there
    given corresponds nearly with that in our Burial Service.

    "Mediâ vitâ in morte sumus:
    Quem quærimus adjutorem nisi Te Domine,
    Qui pro peccatis nostris justè irasceris:
    Sancte Deus, sancte fortis, sancte et misericors Salvator,
    Amaræ morti ne tradas nos.

    "Rambach says, '"In the midst of life" occurs in MSS. of the
    thirteenth century, as an universally common dirge and song
    of supplication on all melancholy occasions, and was in this
    century regularly sung at Compline on Saturdays. A German
    translation was known long before the time of Luther, and was
    enlarged by him by the addition of two strophes.' Martene

Your correspondent J. G. T. asks whence comes the expression in the
Burial Service, "In the midst of life we are in death?" There are some
lines in Petrarch which express precisely the same idea in nearly the
self-same words; but as the thought is by no means an unlikely one to
occur to two separate and independent authors, we may not go to the
length of charging the seeming plagiarism upon the compilers of our
Prayer-Book. I have mislaid the exact reference[5], but subjoin the lines
themselves:

PATRICK'S PURGATORY.

(Vol. vii., p. 552.)

Dr. Lanigan, in his learned _Ecclesiastical History of Ireland_ (vol.
i. p. 368.), states that the so-called Patrick's Purgatory is situated
at Lough Derg (Donegal). It is never mentioned in any of the lives of
the apostle, nor heard of till the eleventh century, the period at
which the canons regular of St. Augustine first appeared, for it was to
persons of that order, as the story goes, that St. Patrick confided the
care of that cavern of wonders. Now there were no such persons in the
island in which it is situated, nor in that of St. Davoc [Dabeoc?] in
the same lake, until about the beginning of the twelfth century. This
purgatory, or purging place, of Lough Derg, was set up against another
Patrick's purgatory, viz. that of Croagh Patrick, mentioned by Jocelyn,
which, however ill-founded the vulgar opinion concerning it, was less
objectionable. Some writers have said that it got the name of Patrick's
Purgatory from an Abbot Patrick, that lived in the ninth century; but
neither were there canons regular of St. Augustine at that time, nor were
such abridged modes of atoning to the Almighty for the sins of a whole
life then thought of. It was demolished in the year 1497, by order of the
Pope, although it has since been in some manner restored.

The original Patrick's Purgatory then, it would appear, was at Croagh
Patrick, in Mayo, near Westport; speaking of the pilgrimages made to
which, the monk Jocelyn (in his _Life of St. Patrick_, written A.D. 1180,
cap. 172.) says that--

    "Some of those who spent a night there stated that they had
    been subjected to most fearful torments, which had the effect,
    as they supposed, of purging them from their sins, for which
    reason also certain of them gave to that place the name of St.
    Patrick's Purgatory."

By the authority of the Lords Justices who governed Ireland in 1633,
previously to the appointment of Wentworth, Lough Derg Purgatory was
once more suppressed; but the sort of piety then fostered among the
members of the Roman communion in Ireland could ill afford to resign
without a struggle what was to them a source of so much consolation.
High influence was, therefore, called into action to procure the
reversal of the sentence; and the Roman Catholic Queen of Charles I.
was induced to address to the Lord Deputy of Ireland a letter in which
she requested that he would be pleased "to allow, that the devotions
which the people of that country have ever been wont to pay to a St.
Patrick's place there, may not be abolished." The Lord Deputy declined
acceding to this request, and said in his reply, "I fear, at this time,
when some men's zeal hath run them already, not only beyond their wits,
_but almost forth of their allegiance too_, it might furnish them with
something to say in prejudice and scandal to his majesty's government,
which, for the present indeed, is by all means to be avoided." And adds,
"your Majesty might do passing well to let this devotion rest awhile."
After this second suppression, the devotion has a second time been "in
some manner restored;" and {179} multitudes throng to the place on
the faith of a false tradition, so long since exposed and exploded by
their own authorities. Three hundred and fifty years ago, the Pope,
the representative of the Bishop of Clogher, and the head of the
Franciscans in Donegal, combined their efforts to put down the scandalous
fabrication; but yet it remains to this day an object of cherished
religious veneration--an object of confidence and faith, on which many
a poor soul casts itself to find consolation and repose. And those
multitudes of pilgrims, year after year, assemble there, no influence
which they look to for guidance forbidding them, to do homage to the vain
delusion.

LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL.

(Vol. viii., p. 100.)

In answer to W. L. M.'s inquiry, "where the virtuous and patriotic
William Lord Russell was buried?" I beg to state that I possess a
pamphlet entitled:

    "The whole Tryal and Defence of William Lord Russel, who Dyed
    a Martyr to the _Romish_ Fury in the Year 1683, with the
    Learned Arguments of the Council on both sides. Together with
    his Behaviour and Speech upon the Scaffold: His Character and
    Behaviour. London: printed by J. Bradford, at the Bible in
    Fetter Lane."

There is no date to it; but from the appearance of the paper, type, a
rude woodcut of the execution, &c., I doubt not that it was printed soon
after the event, or certainly immediately after the Revolution, to meet
the popular wishes to have information on the subject. It consists of
sixteen octavo pages, very closely printed. The opening paragraph says:

    "Among the many that suffered in a _Protestant_ cause [all
    the _Italics_ used in this communication are those of the
    pamphlet], and indeed whose measure seem'd to be the hardest of
    all, was this honorable person _William_ Lord _Russel_, who was
    generally lamented for his excellent Temper and good Qualities;
    being allowed to be one of the most sober and judicious
    Noblemen in the Kingdom, which even his Enemies could not deny;
    and the Merit and Esteem he bore was more cause of Offence
    against him than any Matter that was reap'd up at his Tryal;
    all which in effect was merely grounded upon Malice (I mean
    _Popish_ Malice) that could not be forgot, from his Lordship's
    being one of those earnest sticklers for _Protestant_
    Liberty, and even the very foremost that prefer'd the Bill of
    Exclusion," &c.

Then follows the trial, headed "July 13, 1683, the _Lord_ Russel _came to
his Tryal at the_ Old Bailey." The indictment is described; the names of
the jury are given; judges and counsel named; the evidence, examinations,
and cross-examinations (by Lord Russel) very interestingly narrated: the
Report concluding, after a short address from Lord Russel, "Then the
Court adjourned till four in the afternoon, and brought him in guilty."

These particulars are followed by "_The last Speech and Carriage of the
Lord_ Russel _upon the Scaffold, &c._" As to the executioner's work, all
other accounts that I have seen state that after "two" strokes the head
was severed from the body. The publication says:

    "The Executioner, missing at his first Stroke, though with
    that he took away his Life, at two more severed the Head from
    the Body.... Mr. Sheriff [continues the account] ordered his
    Friends or Servants to take the Body, and dispose of it as they
    pleased, being given them by His Majesty's _Favour and Bounty_."

The narrative proceeds:

    "His Body was conveyed to _Cheneys_ in _Buckinghamshire_, where
    'twas Buried among his Ancestors. There was a great _Storm_,
    and many loud _Claps_ of _Thunder_ the Day of his _Martyrdom_.
    An _Elegy_ was made on him immediately after his Death, which
    seems, by what we have of it, to be writ with some _Spirit_,
    and a great deal of Truth and Good-will; only this Fragment
    on't could be retriev'd, which yet may not be unwelcome to the
    Reader:

    '_'Tis done--he's_ Crown'd, _and one bright_ Martyr _more_,
    _Black_ Rome, _is charg'd on thy too bulky score._
    _All_ like himself, _he mov'd so calm, so free_,
    _A general whisper question'd_--Which is he?
    _Decked like a_ Lover--_tho' pale Death's his_ Bride,
    _He_ came, _and_ saw, _and_ overcame, _and_ dy'd.
    _Earth weeps, and all the vainly pitying Crowd_:
    _But Heaven his Death in_ Thunder _groan'd aloud.'_"


A "sketch of his character" closes the account. Perhaps W. S. M. may deem
these particulars not wholly uninteresting, but tolerably conclusive,
considering the time of publication, when the fact must have been
notorious.

At Banham, Norfolk, in a recess in the wall of the north aisle of the

Blomefield says:

    "It is plain that it was made for Sir Hugh Bardolph, Knight,
    sometime lord of Gray's Manor, in this town, who died in 1203,
    for under his left arm there is a large cinquefoil, which is
    the badge of that family," &c.

Since he wrote, however (1739), with a view to the better preservation
of this interesting relic, some spirited churchwarden has caused it to
be {180} well painted and sanded so that it now looks _almost_ as well
as stone. At the same time, the marks by which Blomefield thought to
identify it are necessarily obliterated.

The effigy of Aymer de Valence referred to in Whitaker ("N. & Q.," Vol.

translation of four Chaldee ones, which form part of a beautiful ode on
the attributes of God, not unmixed with a considerable proportion of the
fabulous, which is sung in every synagogue during the service of the
first day of the feast of Pentecost.

May I now be permitted to ask you, or any of your numerous
correspondents, to inform me who was the _bonâ fide_ translator of Rabbi
Mayir ben Isaac's lines? The English lines are often quoted by itinerant
advocates of charity societies as having been found inscribed, according
to some, on the walls of a lunatic asylum, according to others, on the
walls of a prison, as occasion requires; but extempore quotations on
platforms are sometimes vague.

The verses are in Grose's _Olio_ (p. 292.), and are there said to be
written by nearly an idiot, then living (March 16, 1779) at Cirencester.
It happens, however, that long before the supposed idiot was born, one
Geoffrey Chaucer made use of the same idea, and the same expressions,
although applied to a totally different subject, viz. in his "Balade
warnynge men to beware of deceitful women:"--

    "In soth to saie though all the yerth so wanne
    Wer parchment smoth, white and scribbabell,

    Not coud thei writin woman's treacherie,
    Beware, therefore, the blind eteth many a flie."

Again in the "Remedie of Love," the same lines occur with a few slight
alterations.

In vol. x. of the _Modern Universal History_, p. 430. _note_, I meet with
this sentence:

    "He was succeeded by Jochanan; not in right of descent, but
    of his extraordinary merits; which the Rabbies, according to
    custom, have raised to so surprising a height, that, according
    to them, if the whole heavens were paper, all the trees in the
    world pens, and all the men writers, they would not suffice to
    pen down all his lessons."

In later times, in Miss C. Sinclair's _Hill and Valley_, p. 25., we have:

    "If the lake could be transformed into an ink-stand, the
    mountains into paper; and if all the birds that hover on high
    were to subscribe their wings for quills, it would be still
    insufficient to write half the praise and admiration that are

PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.

_Washing or not washing Collodion Pictures after developing, previous to
fixing._--Since the question has been mooted I have tried both ways, and
have come to the conclusion that there is very little difference in the
resulting appearance of the picture. The hypo. is certainly deteriorated
when no washing is adopted. I think it is best to pour off the first
quantity applied into a cup kept for the purpose; this is discoloured: I
then pour on more clean hypo., and let it remain till the picture clears,
and pour _this_ into another cup or bottle for future use. What was
poured into the first cup may, when a sufficient quantity is obtained,
be filtered, and by adding more of the salt is not useless. I pour on
merely enough at first to wash off the developing fluid, and pour it
off at once. The picture is cleared much sooner if the saturated hypo.
solution is warmed, which I do by plunging the bottle into a pewter pint
pot filled with hot water.

_Stereoscopic Angles_ (Vol. viii., pp. 109. 157.).--I perfectly
agree with your correspondent MR. T. L. MERRITT (p. 109.) respecting
"stereoscopic angles," having arrived at the same conclusion some months
since, while at Hastings, where I produced stereoscopic pictures by
moving the camera _only two inches_: having in one, _seven_ houses and
_five_ bathing-machines; and in the other, _five_ houses and _eight_
bathing-machines. If I had separated the two pictures more, I should have
had _all bathing-machines_ in one and _all houses_ in the other; which
convinced me that nothing more is required than the width of the two eyes
for all distances, or, slightly to exaggerate it, to three inches, which
will produce a pleasing and natural effect: for it is quite certain that
our eyes do not become wider apart as we recede from an object, and that
the intention is to give a true representation of nature as seen by one
person. Now, most stereoscopic pictures represent nature as it never
could be seen by any one person, from the same point of view; and I feel
confident that all photographers, who condescend to make stereoscopic
pictures, will arrive at the same conclusion before the end of this
season.

If this be correct, all difficulty is removed; for it is always advisable
to take two pictures of the same prospect, in case one should not be
good: and two very indifferent negatives will combine into one very good
positive, when viewed by the stereoscope: thus proving the old saying,
that two negatives make an affirmative.

_Sisson's Developing Solution._--In answer to S. B.'s inquiry, I beg to
say, that I have not tried the above solution as a bath. I have always
poured it on, believing that it was easier to observe the progress of
the picture by that mode. If S. B. will forward me his address, I shall
be happy to enter more minutely into my mode of operating with it than
I can through the medium of "N. & Q." I have received other favourable
testimony as to the value of my developing fluid for glass positives.

While I am writing, will you allow me to ask your photographic
correspondents whether any of them have tried Mr. Müller's paper process
referred to by Mr. Delamotte at p. 145. of his work? It was first
announced in the _Athenæum_ of Nov. 2, 1851. When I first commenced
photography (June, 1852), I tried the process; and from what I did
with it, when I was almost entirely ignorant of the manipulation, I am
inclined to think it a valuable process. The sharpness of the tracery in
my church windows, in a picture I took by the process, is remarkable.
Mr. Delamotte truly says: "This is a most striking discovery, as it
supersedes the necessity of any developing agent after the light has
acted on the paper." Mr. Müller says, that simple washing in water seems
to be sufficient to fix the picture. This is also a striking discovery,
and totally unlike any other very sensitive process that I am acquainted
with; and more striking still, that the process should not have been more
practised.

    "The best and most authentic account ever given of Madagascar
    was published in 1729, by Robert Drury, who being shipwrecked
    in the Degrave East Indiaman, on the south side of that island,

    years, and after his return to England, among those who knew

    House), had the character of a downright honest man, without
    any appearance of fraud or imposture."--John Duncombe, M. A.,
    one of the six preachers in Christ Church, Canterbury, 1773.

Mr. Duncombe quotes several statements from Drury which coincide with
those of the Reverend William Hirst, the astronomer, who touched at
Madagascar, on his voyage to India, in 1759. Ten years afterwards Mr.
Hirst perished in the Aurora, and with him the author of _The Shipwreck_.

If the latter be done with reference to standard works of authority, or

May I put a Query on the idea suggested by these lines--that the

of the Countess of Salisbury. Why should this be? That it did imply an
imputation, I judge as well from the vindication of the lady by King
Edward, as also from the proverbial expression used in Scotland, and to
be found in Scott's _Works_, of "casting a leggin girth," as synonymous
with a female "faux pas." I have a conjecture, but should not like to
venture it, without inquiring the general impression as to the origin of
this notion.

_"Short red, God red," &c._ (Vol. vii., p. 500.).--Sir Walter Scott has
committed an oversight when, in _Tales of a Grandfather_, vol. i. p. 85.,
he mentions a murderer of the Bishop of Caithness to have made use of the
expression, "Schort red, God red, slea ye the bischop." Adam, Bishop of
Caithness, was burnt by the mob near Thurso, in 1222, for oppression in
the exaction of tithes; John, Earl of Orkney and Caithness, was killed in
retaliation by the bishop's party in 1231.

The language spoken at that time on the sea-coast of Caithness must
have been Norse. Sutherland would appear to have been wrested from
the Orkney-Norwegians before that period, and the Celtic tongue and
race gaining on the Norse; but on the sea-coast of Caithness I should
apprehend the Norse continued to be the spoken tongue till a later
period, when it was superseded by the Scottish. The Norwegians in the
end of the ninth century colonised Orkney, and expelled or destroyed the
former inhabitants. The Western Isles were also subjugated by them at
that time, and probably Caithness, or at all events a little later. It
would be desirable to know the race and tongue previously existing in
Caithness, and if these were lost in the Norwegians and Norse, and an
earlier Christianity in Scandinavian Paganism. This may, however, lead
to the unfathomably dark subject of the Picts. Is it known when Norse
ceased to be spoken in Caithness? The story of the burning of the Bishop
of Caithness forms the conclusion of the _Orkneyinga Saga_; and vide

remains for {183} me to explain how I fell into the error. It was, then,
from using Mr. Knight's edition of the work for though the orthography
was modernised, which I like, I never dreamed of an editor's taking the
liberty of altering the text of his author. I love to be corrected when
wrong, and here express my thanks to B. H. C. I inform him that there is
another passage in Shakspeare with _its_ in it, but not having marked it,
I cannot find it just now: I think it is in _Lear_.

I have said that I like modernised orthography. We have modernised that
of the Bible, and of the dramatists; why then are we so superstitious
with respect to the barbarous system of Spenser? I am convinced that the
_Fairy Queen_, if printed in modern orthography, would find many readers
who are repelled by the uncouth and absurd spelling of the poet, who
wanted to rhyme to the eye as well as to the ear. Let us then have a
"Spenser for the People."

_Oldham, Bishop of Exeter_ (Vol. vii., pp. 14. 164. 189. 271.).--MR.
WALCOTT will be interested to learn, that Bishop Hugh Oldham was _not_ a
native of Oldham, but was born at Crumpsall, in the parish of Manchester;
as appears from Dugdale's _Visitation of Lancashire_, and the "Lancashire
MSS.," vol. xxxi. His brother, Richard Oldham, appointed 22nd Abbot of
St. Werburgh's Abbey, Chester, in 1452, was afterwards elevated to the
bishoprick of Man, and, dying Oct. 13, 1485, was buried at Chester Abbey,
Chester.

_Dutch Pottery_ (Vol. v., p. 343.; Vol. vi. p. 253.).--At Arnhem, about
sixty-five or seventy years ago, there existed a pottery founded by two
Germans: H. Brandeis, and the well-known savant H. von Laun, maker of the
planetarium (orrery) described by Professor van Swinden, and purchased
by the Society _Felix Meritis_ in Amsterdam. The son of Mr. Brandeis has
still at his residence, No. 419. Rapenburgerstraat, several articles
manufactured there: such as plates, &c. What I have seen is much coarser
than the Saxon porcelain, yet much better than our Delft ware. Perhaps
Mr. Van Embden, grandson and successor of Von Laun, could give farther
information.

P.S.--Allow me to correct some misprints in Vol. vi., p. 253. Dutch

In this respect "N. & Q." should be an exception. For "L_i_chner" read
L_ei_chner; for "Dorp_h_eschrÿver" read Dorp_b_eschrÿver; for "Bl_a_sse"

Two points are to be distinguished, Cranmer's wish that Calvin should
assist in a general union of the churches protesting against Romish
error--Calvin's offer to assist in settling the Church of England. The
latter was declined; and the reason is demonstrated in Archbp. Laurence's
_Bampton Lectures_.

_Portable Altars_ (Vol. viii., p. 101.).--I am not acquainted with any

for the second time, by Jo. Andr. Schmidt, 4to. Helmstad. 1714.

_Poem attributed to Shelley_ (Vol. viii., p. 71.).--The ridiculous
extravaganza attributed to Shelley by an American newspaper, was
undoubtedly never written by that gifted genius. It bears throughout
unmistakeable evidence of its transatlantic origin. No person, who had
not actually witnessed that curious vegetable parasite, the _Spanish
moss_ of the southern states of America, hanging down in long, hairy-like
plumes from the branches of a large tree, would have imagined the lines,--

    "The downy clouds droop
    Like moss upon a tree."

Who, again, could believe that Shelley, an English gentleman and scholar,
could ever, either in writing or conversation, have made use of the
common American vulgarism, "play hell!"

{184}

The question of the authorship of such a production, apart from its being
attributed to Shelley, is, in my humble opinion, a matter of little or no
interest. But as a probable guess, I should say that it carries strong
internal evidence of having been written by that erratic mortal, Edgar
Poe.

_Lady Percy, Wife of Hotspur (Daughter of Edmumd Mortimer, Earl of
March)_ (Vol. viii., p. 104.).--On reference to the volume and page
of Miss Strickland's _Lives of the Queens of England_, cited by your
correspondent G., I find that not only does this lady, by her sweeping
assertion, bastardise the second E. of Northumberland, but, in her
zeal to outsay all that "ancient heralds" ever can have said, she
annihilates, or at least reduces to a myth, the mother of Thomas, eighth
Lord Clifford. This infelicitous statement may have been corrected in
the second edition of the _Lives_, for in "N. & Q.," Vol. vii., p. 42.,
there is a detailed pedigree tracing the descent of Jane Seymour through
Margaret Wentworth, her mother, by an intermarriage with a Wentworth,
and a _granddaughter_ of Hotspur, Lord Percy, (not _daughter_, as Miss
Strickland writes) from the blood-royal of England. My object, however,
in writing this is not farther to point attention to Miss Strickland's
mistake, but to invite discussion to the point where this pedigree may
be possibly faulty. I will not say "all ancient heralds," but some
heralds, at least, of acknowledged reputation, viz. Nicolas, Collins,
and Dugdale[6], have stated that the wife of Sir Philip Wentworth was
a daughter of Roger fifth Lord Clifford. If this be so, in truth there
is an end at once of the Seymour's claim to royal lineage; for it is an
undoubted fact that it was the grandson of Roger fifth Lord, namely,
John, seventh Lord Clifford, K.G., who married Hotspur's only daughter.

"_Up, guards, and at them!_" (Vol. v., p. 426.; Vol. viii., p.
111.).--Some years ago, about the time that the Wellington statue on the
arch at Hyde Park Corner was erected, I was dining at a table where Wyatt
the artist was present. The conversation turned much upon the statue, and
the exact period at which the great Duke is represented. Wyatt said that
he was represented at that moment when he is supposed to have used the
words: "Up, guards, and at them!" It having been questioned whether he
ever uttered the words, I asked the artist whether, when he was taking
the Duke's portrait, the Duke himself acknowledged using them? To which
he replied, that the Duke said that he did not recollect having uttered
those words and, in fact, that he could not say what expression he did
use on that occasion. The company at dinner seemed much satisfied with
Wyatt's authority on this point.

J. D. GARDNER.

_Pennycomequick_ (Vol. viii., p. 113.).--A similar story to that related
by your correspondent MR. HELE is told of Falmouth. Previously to its
being incorporated as a town by Charles II., it was called _Smithick_,
from a smith's shop, near a _creek_, which extended up the valley. The
old Cornish word _ick_ signifies a "creek;" and as it became a village it
was called "Pennycomequick," which your correspondent H. C. K. clearly
explains. The Welsh and Cornish languages are in close affinity. The
name "Pennycomequick" is evidently a corrupted old Cornish name: see
Pryce's _Archæologia Cornu-Britannica_, v. "Pen," "Coomb," and "Ick,"
the head of the narrow valley, defile or creek. It has been thought by
some to mean "the head of the cuckoo's valley;" and your correspondent's
Welsh derivation seems to countenance such a translation. The cuckoo is
known in Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall as "the _Gawk_ Gwich." MR. HELE,
perhaps, will be amused at the traditional story of the Falmouthians
respecting the origin of Pennycomequick. Before the year 1600, there
were few houses on the site of the present town: a woman, who had been a
servant with an ancestor of the late honourable member for West Cornwall,
Mr. Pindarves, came to reside there, and that gentleman directed her to
brew some good ale, as he should occasionally visit the place with his
friends. On one of his visits he was disappointed, and expressed himself
angry at not finding any ale. It appeared on explanation that a Dutch
vessel came into the harbour the preceding day, and the Dutchmen drained
her supply; she said the _Penny come so quick_, she could not refuse to
sell it.

_Captain Booth of Stockport_ (Vol. viii., p. 102.).--In answer to MR.
HUGHES'S inquiry about this antiquary, I beg to state that he will find
an _Ordinary of Arms_, drawn up by Captain Booth of Stockport, in the
Shepherd Library, Preston, Lancashire. It is one among the numerous
valuable MSS. given by the executors of the late historian of Lancashire,
Ed. Baines, Esq., M.P., to that library. In Lysons' _Magna Britannia_
(volume Cheshire), your correspondent will also find a mention of a John
Booth, Esq., of Twemlow, Cheshire, who was the author of various heraldic
manuscripts. It may, perhaps, be hardly necessary to inform Cheshire
antiquaries that an almost inexhaustible fund of information, on heraldry
and genealogy, is to be found in the manuscripts of Randle Holme,
formerly of Chester, which are {185} now preserved among the Harleian
MSS. in the British Museum.

_"Hurrah," &c._ (Vol. viii., p. 20.).--The _clameur de Haro_ still exists
in Jersey, and is the ancient form there of opposing all encroachments
on landed property, and the first step to be taken by which an ejectment
can be finally obtained. It was decided in Pinel and Le Gallais, that the
_clameur de Haro_ does not apply to the opposal of the execution of a
decree of the Royal Court.

It is a remarkable feature in this process, that it is carried on by the
crown; and that the losing party, whether plaintiff or defendant, is
mulcted in a small fine to the king, because the sacred name of _Haro_ is
not to be carelessly invoked with impunity.

etc. de Jersey_, par Marett, vol. i. p. 294.

I do not think that the explanation of these words, quoted by MR. BRENT,
is much more probable than that of "Hierosolyma est perdita." In the
first place, if we are to believe Dr. Johnson, _hips_ are not _sloes_,
but the fruit or seed-vessels of the dog-rose or briar, which usually go
by that name, and from which it would be difficult to make any infusion
resembling wine. In the next place, it will be found, on reference to
Ben Jonson's lines "over the door at the entrance into the Apollo" (vol.
vii. p. 295., ed. 1756), of which the distich forms a part, that it is
misquoted. The words are,--

    "Hang up all the poor _hop_-drinkers,
    Cries old Sym, the king of skinkers;"

the hop or ale-drinkers being contrasted with the votaries of wine, "the
milk of Venus," and "the true Phœbeian liquor." Is it not possible, after
all, that the repetition of, "Hip, hip, hip," is merely intended to mark
the time for the grand exertion of the lungs to be made in enunciating
the final "Hurrah!"?

_Detached Belfry Towers_ (Vol. vii., p. 333.; Vol. viii., p. 63.).--The
bell-tower at Hackney, mentioned by B. H. C., is that of the old parish
church of St. Augustine. This church was rebuilt in the early part of the
sixteenth century, which is about the time of the present tower; and when
the church was finally taken down in 1798, the tower was forced to be
left standing, because the new parish church of St. John-at-Hackney was
not strong enough to support the peal of eight bells.

_Blotting-paper_ (Vol. viii., p. 104.).--I am disposed to agree with
SPERIEND in thinking Carlyle must be mistaken in saying this substance
was not used in Cromwell's time. The ordinary means for drying writing
was by means of the fine silver sand, now but rarely used for that
purpose; but I have seen pieces of blotting-paper among MSS. of the
time of Charles I., so as to lead me to think it was even then used,
though sparingly. This is only conjecture; but I can, however, establish
its existence at a rather earlier date than 1670. In an "Account of
Stationery supplied to the Receipt of the Exchequer and the Treasury,
1666-1668," occur several entries of "one quire of blotting-paper," "two
quires of blotting," &c. Earlier accounts of the same kind (which may be
at the Rolls House, Chancery Lane) might enable one to fix the date of
its introduction.

J. B-T.

The following occurs in Townesend's _Preparative to Pleading_ (Lond.
12mo. 1675), p. 8.:

    "Let the dusting or sanding of presidents in books be avoided,
    rather using _fine brown paper to prevent blotting_, if time
    of the ink's drying cannot be allowed; for sand takes away the
    good colour of the ink, and getting into the backs of books
    makes them break their binding."

From this passage it may be inferred, that fine brown paper, to prevent
blotting, was then rather a novelty.

Although, like Canning's knife-grinder, we do not care to meddle with
politics, we have one volume on our table belonging to that department of
life which deserves passing mention, we mean Mr. Urquhart's _Progress of
Russia in the West, North, and South, by opening the Sources of Opinion,
and appropriating the {186} Channels of Wealth and Power_, which those
who differ most widely from Mr. Urquhart will probably deem worth
reading at a moment when all eyes are turned towards St. Petersburgh. It
is of course a knowledge of the great interest everywhere felt in the
Russian-Turkish question, which has induced Messrs. Longman to reprint
in their _Traveller's Library_, in a separate form and with additions,
_Turkey and Christendom, an Historical Sketch of the Relations between
the Ottoman Empire and the States of Europe_.

The Rev. R. W. Eyton announces for publication by subscription
_Antiquities of Shropshire_, which is intended to contain such accessible
materials as may serve to illustrate the history of the county during the
first two centuries after the Norman Conquest, though that period is not
proposed as an invariable limit. The preface to the first Number will
give an account of the public authorities which the author has consulted,
as well as of the materials which have been supplied or promised by the
kindness of individuals. Each Number will contain six sheets (96 pages),
and will be accompanied by maps or illustrations referable to the period.
Each fourth Number will include an Index. The first part will be put to
press as soon as 200 Subscribers are obtained, and the number of copies
printed will be limited to those originally subscribed for.

We are again indebted to Mr. Bohn for several valuable additions to our

    "This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
    nourishing and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many
    cases, all kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in
    confined habit of body, as also diarrhœa, bowel complaints,
    affections of the kidneys and bladder, such as stone or gravel;
    inflammatory irritation and cramp of the urethra, cramp of
    the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and hemorrhoids. This
    really invaluable remedy is employed with the most satisfactory
    result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints, where
    irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary
    and bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually
    the troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth
    to express the conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica
    is adapted to the cure of incipient hectic complaints and
    consumption.

    EXAMPLE.--At the commencement of the year 1841, a person aged
    thirty took out a Policy for 1000_l._, the annual payment for
    which is 24_l._ 1_s._ 8_d._: in 1847 he had paid in premiums
    168_l._ 11_s._ 8_d._; but the profits being 2¼ per cent. per
    annum on the sum insured (which is 22_l._ 10_s._ per annum
    for each 1000_l._) he had 157_l._ 10_s._ added to the Policy,
    almost as much as the premiums paid.

The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
