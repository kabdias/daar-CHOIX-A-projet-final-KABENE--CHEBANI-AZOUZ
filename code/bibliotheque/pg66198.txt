THE ENGLISH, IRISH, AND SCOTCH KNIGHTS OF THE ORDER OF ST. JOHN OF
JERUSALEM.

For the following list of the English, Irish, and Scotch knights of the
Order of St. John, who are mentioned in the records of this island when
under its rule, I am in a great measure indebted to Dr. Vella, who, after
having made at my request a diligent search through very many old volumes
and manuscripts, has kindly favoured me with the result of his labours.
The names of the knights and places mentioned in this Note are written,
in every instance, as Dr. Vella and myself have seen them recorded.
Before commencing with the list, I have a few remarks to offer, that the
terms peculiar to the Order which I shall make use of may be understood
by those of your readers who are unacquainted with its history.

The English tongue comprised the priories of England, Ireland, and
Scotland, and thirty-two different commanderies. Its property, which was
seized by Henry VIII. in 1534, was afterwards restored by Queen Mary, and
finally and effectually confiscated by Elizabeth in the first year of her
reign. Her Majesty's order for the seizure of the Irish estates was dated
on the 3rd of June, 1559, and addressed to William Fitzwilliam. Vide the
"Diplomatic Code of the Order," and Rymer, vol. xv. p. 527.

Although Dr. Vella and myself had every wish to classify the knights
of the English tongue under their different languages, still we have
failed in our first attempt, and to enable us to succeed we must ask
for assistance from your correspondents in England. They must be known
by their names; thus, for instance, the Dundas's of 1524 and 1538 were
as evidently of Scotch, as the Russells of 1536, 1537, and 1554 were of
English descent. We might apply the same remark to many other knights
whose names will be found recorded in the following list.

Whenever a vacancy occurred by the death of a grand master, who was
always a sovereign prince, the election for his successor could only take
place in the convent. It was not necessary that the person elected should
be present. Villiers De {190} L'Isle Adam was residing in France in
1521, when his brethren at Rhodes made him their chief. The grand priors,
commanders, and knights, who were absent from Malta, whether employed
in the service of the Order or not, had neither voice nor ballot in the
election; and the more effectually to prevent their interference, as also
that of the Roman pontiff, only three days were allowed to transpire
before a successor was chosen, and proclaimed as the head of the convent.

Henry VIII. addressed L'Isle Adam as follows: "Reverendissimo in Christo
Patri Domini, F. de Villers L. Isleadam, Magno Hierosolymitani Ordinis
Magistro, et consanguineo, et amico nostro carissimo." George II., as the
king of a Protestant country, sent a letter to Emmanuel Pinto, bearing
the following superscription: "Eminentissimo Principi Domino Emanueli
Pinto, Magno Ordinis Melitensis Magistro, Consanguineo, et Amico Nostro
Carissimo."

Boisgelin has stated in the first volume of his _History of Malta_, p.
194., that the--

    "King of England addressed the grand master by the following
    titles: 'Eminentissime princeps consanguinea et amice noster
    carissime.' The King of France gave the Order the title of
    'Très chers et bons amis;' and the grand master that of 'Très
    cher et très aimé cousin," in the same style as he addressed
    the Dukes of Tuscany."

That this note may not occupy too much space in your interesting,
publication, I would now merely remark that the "convent" was known as
the place where the grand master, or his lieutenant, resided, and the
"tongue," according to the code of the Order, was the term applied to a
nation. A grand prior was the chief of his language, who resided in his
native country. A "Turcopolier" was the title of the conventual bailiff
of the venerable language of England, "and it took its name from the
Turcopoles, a sort of light horse mentioned in the history of the wars
carried on by the Christians in Palestine." The English knights won for
themselves this high honour by their gallantry in the Holy Land, and in
remembrance it ever after remained with their tongue. A Turcopolier was
the third dignity in the convent, and the last knight who enjoyed it was
Sir Richard Shelley, Prior of England. At his decease the grand master
assumed the title for himself. The two interesting letters addressed
by Sir Richard Shelley to Henry VIII., in which he complained of his
majesty's treatment to the Order of St. John, and pleaded in its favour,
were published in the English language, and five years ago were to be
seen in the government library of this island. But, on my asking a
short time ago to refer to them, I regretted to find that they had been
taken from the library by a _gentleman_ who was well introduced to the
librarian, and whose conduct in this, and some other transactions where
valuable books are concerned, cannot be too strongly condemned. Before
returning from this brief digression to the subject of my Note, might I
ask if these letters are known in England, and whether copies could be
easily procured for a friend who is desirous of having them inserted in a
forthcoming publication?

The Knights of St. John being members of a masonic institution, termed
each other brothers, is customary with members of the craft at the
present time. And it may not be out of place to remark that several of
the chapels, churches, and fortifications of Malta are ornamented with
masonic signs and emblems, which have been several times referred to,
and cleverly explained within the last three years in different numbers
of the _Masonic Quarterly Review_. Those of your readers who take an
interest in masonry may peruse these papers of a distinguished mason, now
stationed in the West Indies, with instruction and pleasure.

Boisgelin has recorded in the first volume of his _History of Malta_, p.
182., that the Order of St. John of Jerusalem "might with propriety be
considered as being at the same time hospitaller, religious, military,
republican, aristocratical, monarchical," and lastly, as if these
different terms, which, without his explanation, would appear to be
incorrect as applying to one institution, were not sufficient, he has
added in a note, that in the last days of its existence it might also
have been called democratical. He has stated that it was--

    "Hospitaller, from having hospitals constantly open for the
    reception of the sick of all countries and religions, whom the
    knights attended in person. Religious, because the members
    took the three vows of chastity, obedience, and poverty, which
    last consisted in having no property independent of the Order
    at large, and on that account the Pope was their superior.
    Military, from being constantly armed, and always at war with
    the infidels. Republican, as their chief was chosen from
    among themselves, and could not enact laws, or carry them
    into execution, without their consent. Aristocratical, since
    none but the knights and grand master had any share in the
    legislative and executive power. Monarchical, from having a
    superior who could not be dispossessed of his dignity, and was
    invested with the right of sovereignty over the subjects of the
    order, together with those of Malta and its dependencies. And
    lastly, Democratical, from the introduction of a language which
    did not require any proofs of nobility."[1]

Before taking leave of Boisgelin, it should be recorded that he was a
Knight of Malta; and his history, one of the best now extant, appeared
in {191} those troubled times, when he hoped by conciliating all
governments, to see his Order again restored. Influenced in all things by
this hope, vain as it was, his statements should be received with some
grains of allowance.

Before calling attention to the following list, I have to state that a
knight could not become commander before he had made four cruises in the
galleys, or served five years in the convent. He had also to remain three
years a commander before he could claim a pension. Those knights who are
known to have been at Malta will be distinguished by a †.

      to the greatest extremity, the Roman Pontiff

      should allow him out of its revenue a thousand
      ducats a-year. The Spanish knights objecting to
      pay this sum, there was a trial before the Grand
      Master to enforce it; a report of which is now in
      the Record Office. The Pope's decree was confirmed.

DUPORT'S LINES TO IZAAK WALTON.

Sometime since I met with the following epigrams of the learned scholar,
divine, and loyalist James Duport, written on the fly-leaf of a copy of
his _Musæ Subsecivæ, seu Poetica Stromata_, presented by him to Izaak
Walton. I presume that they have never been printed, and that they were
written in Duport's own hand. If so, they may be thought worthy of a
place in the columns of "N. & Q." They will be read with some interest by
those who respect Duport, and love the memory of good old Izaak Walton. I
may add, that the autograph of I. W. is in the book, thus:

SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.

Besides these nine verbatim coincidences, the following four are very

    dreams."--_Restorations and Illustrations_, p. 114.

    Folios.--"Confounds the tongue, and makes the senses _rough_."

    Jackson.--"Confounds the tongue, and makes the senses

    painting, hath betray'd him."

    Collier MS.--"Who _smothers her with painting_, hath betray'd

    Jackson.--"Who _smoother_ was: her painting hath betray'd
    him."--_Restorations and Illustrations_, p. 375.

Besides these four emendations, which at any rate are very suggestive
of those in Mr. Collier's folio, I beg to call attention to Jackson's
defence of Theobald's (and his own) proposition to read _untread_ for
_unthread_, in _King John_, Act V. Sc. 4., which is strikingly like
Mr. Collier's defence of the same reading in the margin of the Folio
1632. {194} The whole of Jackson's notes on _King John_ are well worth
reading. I beg to mention two of these, as illustrations of old Jackson's
acuteness, when not under the warping influence of the _cacoëthes
emendandi_. His defence of _untrimmed bride_, in Act II. Sc. 1., is most
convincing. He says,--

    "Constance stimulates [Lewis] to stand fast to his purpose,
    and not to let the devil tempt him, in the likeness of an
    _untrimmed_ bride, to waver in his determination; for that the
    influence of the Holy See would strip King John of his present
    royalty. Where then would be the great dowry Lewis was to
    receive with his wife? At present he has only the _promise_ of
    five provinces, and 30,000 marks of English coin; therefore as
    the dowry has not been paid, Blanche is still an _untrimmed_
    bride."--_Recollections and Illustrations_, p. 179.

His note on the use of _invisible_, in Act V. Sc. 7., is also excellent:

    "Death having prayed upon the reduced body of the king, quits
    it, and now _invisible_, has laid siege to the mind."

I have elsewhere stated my opinion that "all Jackson's emendations are
bad." I should have added that some few are very plausible and specious,
and worthy of consideration. I will mention one in _King John_, Act IV.
Sc. 2. Pembroke says,--

    "If, what _in rest_ you have, in right you hold," &c.

Now, _rest_ and _right_ are no antithesis, nor are they allied in
meaning. Jackson inserts a _t'_ between _in_ and _rest_--

    "If, what _int'rest_ you have in right you hold," &c.--

which he supports by admirable parallels from the same play. I will cite
one more example of Jackson's sagacity, from his notes on _1 Henry IV._,
Act I. Sc. 3. Hotspur says,--

    "Never did _bare and_ rotten policy," &c.

Jackson reads,--

    "Never did _barren_ rotten policy," &c.

Mr. Collier never once refers to Jackson. Mr. Singer, however, talks
familiarly about Jackson, in his _Shakspeare Vindicated_, as if he had
him at his fingers' ends; and yet, at page 239., he favours the world
with an _original_ emendation (viz. "He did _behood_ his anger," _Timon_,
Act III. Sc. 1.), which, however, will be found at page 389. of Jackson's
book. I may be in error, but I cannot but think such ignorance, on the
part of professional Shakspearians, very culpable.

_On Three Passages in "Measure for Measure."_--I have to crave a small
space in your columns, which have already done much good service for
the text of Shakspeare, to make a very few remarks on three passages in
the play of _Measure for Measure_. It is no sweeping change of reading
that I am about to advocate, nor, as I think, anything over ingenious;
inasmuch as, in two of the passages in question, I propose to defend the
reading of the first folio, which, I contend, has been departed from
unnecessarily; while, in the third, I suggest the simple change of an _f_
into an _s_.

In Act II. Sc. 4., these lines occur in Angelo's soliloquy, in my folio
of 1623:

            "The state whereon I studied
    Is like a good thing, being often read,
    Growne feard and tedious."

Mr. Knight, and other editors, read _feard_, as in the original, but give
no explanation; though such a strange epithet would seem to require one.
I propose to read _seared_, _i.e._ dry, the opposite of fresh. This,
as the saying is, "requires," I think, "only to be pointed out to be
admitted."

Lower down in the same scene we find the following passage, in one of
Angelo's addresses to Isabel:

                    "Such a person,
    Whose creadit with the judge, or owne great place,
    Could fetch your brother from the manacles
    Of the all-building law."

The word _building_ has always been a stumbling-block to editors. Johnson
first proposed to read _binding_, and his successors have adopted it, and
such is now the generally received reading. Mr. Collier's old corrector
is also in favour of the same change. I have always felt convinced,
however, that _building_ was the word which Shakspeare wrote. That
which answers to it in the A.-S. is _bytling_, _bytleing_, a building;
_bytlian_, to build; which are inflected from _byth_, _biotul_, a hammer
or mallet (whence our _beetle_); so that the strict meaning of the verb
is _firmare_, _confirmare_, to fasten, close, or bind together. This will
give much the same meaning to _building_ as that implied in the proposed
substitute _binding_.

Not having met with the word used in this peculiar sense by any old
writer, I could not venture to maintain the reading of the folio on
these grounds, which I have just mentioned, alone. At length, however, I
have been successful, and I am now able to quote a passage from a work
published very shortly before this play, entitled:

    "The Jewel House of Art and Nature", &c., "faithfully and
    familiarly set downe according to the Author's owne experience,
    by Hugh Platte, of Lincoln's Inne, gentleman. London, 1594."

in which this word _building_ is used in precisely the same sense as that
which I defend. In "the Preface of the Author," the following passage
occurs:

    "I made a condicionall promise of some farther discouerie in
    arteficiall conceipts, then either my health {195} or leisure
    would then permit: I am now resolued (notwithstanding the
    vnkind acceptation of my first fruits, which then I feared and
    hath since falne out, is a sufficient release in law of the
    condition) to make the same in some sort absolute (though not
    altogether according to the fulnesse of my first purpose), and
    to become a _building_ word unto me."

I apprehend that this parallel instance is all that is wanting to
preserve, for the future, the reading of the first folio unimpaired.

The third passage on which I have a remark to offer, is that much
tormented one in Act III. Sc. 1., which stands in my first folio thus:

    "_Cla._ The prenzie, Angelo?

    _Isa._ Oh, 'tis the cunning liuerie of hell,
    The damnest bodie to inuest, and couer
    In prenzie gardes."

I need not say a word about the various suggestions of _primzie_,
_priestly_, _princely_, _precise_, &c., which have appeared from time to
time; my business is solely with the original word in the first folio. I
have always felt sure that this is none other than the poet's own word,
and no error of the printer; for how could it be possible to make a
gross mistake in a word which occurs twice within four lines, and one,
moreover, so unusual; the printer must surely have been able to decipher
the letters from _one_ of the two written specimens. It will be observed
that there is a comma after _prenzie_ in the original, indicating that
the word is a substantive, not an adjective. Now what is the Italian for
a prince? Not only _principe_, but also _prenze_; and in like manner we
find _principessa_ and _prenzessa_. I have no doubt that what Shakspeare
_did_ write was--

    "The prenzie, Angelo?"

while a little lower down he converted the word into an adjective:

            "To inuest and couer
    In prenzie gardes."

It is obvious to remark that this meaning of _prenzie_ exactly fits the
sense: Angelo was a prince, and he was clad in robes of office, adorned
with princely "gardes," or trappings. Shakspeare, no doubt, was very well
acquainted with Italian tales and poems; the word may have become quite
familiar to him. His intention here, in putting the term in question
into Claudio's mouth, may have been to give an Italian character to the
scene, introducing thus the _local term of dignity_ of the deputy; thus
recalling the audience, by the occurrence of a single word, to the scene
of the plot; for though this is said to be in Vienna, yet it is to be
observed that not a name throughout the play is German, _everything is
Italian_. And let it not be objected that the use of this word involves
an obscurity which Shakspeare would have avoided; we are hardly able to
judge, now-a-days, whether a particular word was obscure or not in his
time: at all events, there would be no difficulty in adducing instances
of what we should call more obscure allusions, and I think there can be
little doubt that the well-educated in those days well understood the
Italian _prenze_ to mean a prince.

_"Hamlet" and G. Steevens._--In Act I. Sc. 4., Horatio asks Hamlet "_What
does this_ mean, my Lord?" (The noise of music within). Hamlet replies:

    Keeps wassel, and _the swaggering up-spring reels_."

G. Steevens, in a note of this passage, says: "The _swaggering up-spring_
was _a German dance_." Is not the allusion directed to the king, whom
Hamlet describes as "a swaggering _up-spring_," or "_upstart_?" Should
not the line--

    _"O horrible, O horrible, most horrible!"_

in the Ghost's narrative in the _fifth scene_, be given to Hamlet?

_Similarity of Idea in St. Luke and Juvenal._--Examples of identity of
expression existing between the Scriptures and ancient heathen writers
have already appeared in "N. & Q." Permit me to add the following
passages, which appear to me to afford an instance of similarity of idea:

    "Λέγω ὑμῖν, ὅτι ἐὰν οὗτοι σιωπήσωσῖν, οἱ λίθοι
    κεκρὰξονται."--_Luc._ cap xix. v. 40.

                                      "Audis,

    Debueras, vel marmoreus, vel aëneus?"

                           Juven. _Sat._ xiii. v. 113.

The satirist would seem to say (taking the sceptic's view), that even if
Jupiter existed only in brass and marble, the very statues would "cry
out" against the impious perjury.

_Sincere._--Trench, _On the Study of Words_, 4th ed., p. 197., says:

    "They would be pleased to learn that 'sincere' may be, I will
    not say that it is, without wax (sine cerâ), as the best and
    finest honey should be."

{196}

Is not this derivation erroneous? _Sincere_ does not mean "pure, like
virgin-honey;" but it expresses the absence of deception. I doubt not
that it is derived from--

    "The practice of Roman potters to rub wax into the flaws of
    their unsound vessels when they sent them to market. A sincere
    [without wax] vessel was the same as a sound vessel, one that
    had no disguised flaw."

So says Bushnell (_God in Christ_, p. 17.). The derivation is no novelty.
I reproduce it merely to correct an error which is obtaining currency
under the name of Mr. French. I should be obliged to any of your
correspondents who would refer me to, or still better cite, any passages
in the Latin classics relating to the practice I have mentioned.

THE CRESCENT.

I shall be obliged to any correspondent of "N. & Q." who will point out
the period at which the crescent became the standard of Mahometanism.
Poets and romancers freely bestow it upon any time or scene in which
Mussulmans are introduced; Sir Walter Scott mentions it in the
_Talisman_, but after the strange liberties he has taken with Saladin
and Richard, he becomes, on such a question, no higher authority than
writers of meaner name. I cannot find it in the history of Mahomet, or
in that of his immediate successors. The first time Michaud, in his fine
_Histoire des Croisades_, speaks of it is in the reign of Mahomet II.,
which is many centuries after periods at which modern poets, and even
historians, have named it as the antagonistic standard to the cross. The
crescent is common upon the reverses of coins of the Eastern empire long
before the Turkish conquest, and was, I have reason to believe, in some
degree peculiar to the Sclave nations. Was it the standard of the Turks,
as contradistinguished from other Saracens? or, was it adopted by Mahomet
II. after his conquests of Constantinople and the eastern countries of
Europe? I am aware that if this last idea be substantiated, it will make
it much more modern than it is generally supposed to be, but our ideas of
everything, Turkish were for so long a time mixed with the wonderful and
the romantic, that we must not expect much correctness on such points.
The Turks came into fearful contiguity with the West in the fifteenth
century; Europe had as much to dread from them then as from the Russians
now. This event and the art of printing were almost cotemporary, and the
crescent has been presented to us as the symbol of Mahometanism ever
since; but I much doubt it can be proved to have been so at a far remoter
period.

Haute, then pastor at Sluis, to the brethren of the Flemish Class, since
"they had taken knowledge of the sound and good gifts of their brother."
He left Sluis soon after, probably in July, 1583, and withdrew to

Peter Lambert was a student of the University of Ghent: though, as far

made known his wish to propose himself as candidate for the ministry;
and on August 4 appeared Peter Lambert, student of the University of
Ghent, before the consistory, requesting the brethren to grant him the
twenty-five guilders which had been promised; because, on account of
the troubled state of the country, he wished to flee to England, on
which request was decided: "Since a well-known and pious brother, who is
compelled to flee, is in need of help, let the deacons and _pensionary_

refuge in England. Can any one give me farther information?--From the

_Attainment of Majority._--Professor DE MORGAN will, I am sure, permit me
to put this question to him:

In a short treatise "On Ancient and Modern Usage in Reckoning," written
by him for the _Companion to the Almanac_ of 1850, he explains, at page
9., the usage of attainment of majority in these words:

    "Nevertheless in the law, which here preserves _the old
    reckoning_, he is of full age on the 9th: though he were born
    on the 10th, he is of age to execute a settlement _a minute
    after midnight_ on the morning of the 9th."

I want to have this statement reconciled with the opening scene of Ben
Jonson's _Staple of News_, where Pennyboy jun. counts, as his watch
strikes--"one, two, three, four, five, six!"--

    "Enough, enough, dear watch,
    Thy pulse hath beat enough
    --The hour is come so long expected," &c.

Then "the fashioner" comes in to fit on the heir's new clothes; he had
"waited below 'till the clock struck," and gives, as an excuse, "your
worship might have pleaded _nonage_, if you had got 'em on ere I could
make just affidavit of the time."

All these particulars are too _verbatim_ to admit of doubt as to the
peculiar usage of that time; and from other sources I know that Ben
Jonson was right: but it is not alluded to in the treatise first
mentioned, nor is it stated when the usage was altered to "a minute after
midnight."

BEE-PARK--BEE-HALL.

(Vol. v., pp. 322. 498.)

Enjoying as we do the advantages of the extension of scientific
knowledge, and its application to our routine of daily wants, we are
apt to forget that our forefathers were without many things we deem
essentials. Your correspondents C. W. G. and B. B. have touched upon a
curious feature of antiquity, which science and commerce have rendered
obsolete. Yet, before the introduction of sugar, bees were important
ministers to the luxuries of the great, as mentioned at the above-cited
pages. I was struck with the following passage in the first forest
charter of King Henry III.:

    "Every freeman ... shall likewise have the honey which shall be
    found in his woods."

This, in a charter second only in importance, perhaps, to Magna Charta
itself, sounds strange to our ideas; moderns would not think it a very
royal boon. But the note with which Mr. R. Thomson (_Historical Essay
on the Magna Charta of King John_, p. 352.) illustrates this passage is
interesting, and, though rather long, may be worth insertion in your
columns:

    "The second part of this chapter secures to the woodland
    proprietor all the honey found in his woods; which was
    certainly a much more important gift than it would at first
    appear, since the Hon. Daines Barrington remarks, that perhaps
    there has been no lawsuit or question concerning it for the
    last three hundred years. In the middle ages, however, the
    use of honey was very extensive in England, as sugar was not
    brought hither until the fifteenth century; and it was not
    only a general substitute for it in preserving, but many of
    the more luxurious beverages were principally composed of it,
    as mead, metheglin, pigment, and morat, and these were famous
    from the Saxon days, down even to the time of the present
    charter (1217). In the old Danish and Swedish laws bees form a
    principal subject; and honey was a considerable article of rent
    in Poland, in which it was a custom to bind any one who stole
    it to the tree whence it was taken. The Baron de Mayerberg also
    relates, that when he travelled in Muscovy in 1661, he saw
    trees there expressly adapted to receive bees, which even those
    who felled their own wood were enjoined to take down in such a
    manner that they who prepared them should have the benefit of
    the honey. Nor was the wax of less importance to the woodland
    proprietors of England, since candles of tallow are said to
    have been first used only in 1290, and those of wax were so
    great a luxury, that in some places they were unknown: but a
    statute concerning wax-chandlers, passed in 1433 (the 11th of
    Henry VI. chap. 12.), states that wax was then used in great
    quantities for the images of saints. Only referring, however,
    to the well-known use of large wax tapers by King Alfred in
    the close of the ninth century, it may be observed that in the
    laws of Hoel Dha, king of South Wales, which are acknowledged
    as authentic historical documents, made about A.D. 940, of
    much older materials, is mentioned the right of the king's
    chamberlain to as much wax as he could bite from the end of
    a taper."--_Coke_; _Manwood_; _Barrington_; _Statutes of the
    Realm_.

Perhaps you will allow a few words more in illustration of B. B.'s Query
(Vol. v., p. 498.). A recent correspondent, writing of some modern
experiments on the venom of toads, suggests the propriety of contributing
to a list of "vulgar errors" which have proved to be "vulgar truths." It
would not much surprise me to learn that, after all, the popular belief
in the efficacy of the rough music of the key and warming-pan might be
added to his list. At all events the reason stated by B. B. to prove its
uselessness, viz. that bees have no sense of hearing, must, I think, be
abandoned, as a Query of MR. SYDNEY SMIRKE (Vol. vii., p. 499.), and an
answer (Vol. vii., p. 633.), will show. That all insects are possessed
of hearing, naturalists seem now as well convinced of as that they have
eyes; though some naturalists formerly considered they were not, as
Linnæus and Bonnet; while Huber (his interesting observations on bees
notwithstanding) seems to have been quite undecided on the point. Bees,
as well as all other insects, hear through the medium of their antennæ,
which in a subordinate degree are used as feelers; observing which,
perhaps, Huber and others were indisposed to ascribe to them the sense in
question.

In reference to MR. SYDNEY SMIRKE'S Query, so far from other naturalists
confirming Huber's observations as to the effect produced by the sound
emitted by the _Sphynx atropos_ on the bees, besides Dr. Bevan (quoted
Vol. vii., p. 633.), the intelligent entomologist, Mr. Duncan, author
of the entomological portion of _The Naturalist's Library_ (vol. xxxiv.
pp. 53-55.), completely disproves them. He tells us that he has closely
watched bees, and has seen the queen attack the larva cells; but the
sentinels, notwithstanding the reiteration of the queenly sound, so far
from remaining motionless, {200} held their sovereign in check, and
stubbornly persisted in the defence of their charge against the attacks
of their queen and mother. Besides this disproval of the incapacitation
of bees by the emission of a sound, another from the experiments of Huber
himself may be mentioned. He introduced a _Sphynx atropos_ into a hive in
the daytime, and it was immediately attacked and killed by the workers.
Query, Might not the explanation of the robbery of hives by this moth be,
that the darkness of night incapacitates the bees, while it is the time
nature has provided for the wanderings of the _Sphynx_?

MILTON'S WIDOW.

(Vol. vii., p. 596.; Vol. viii., pp. 12. 134.)

A contribution of mine to the miscellaneous vol. of the Chetham Society's
publications having been introduced to your readers by the handsome
notice of MR. HUGHES, I feel bound to notice the objection raised by
your correspondent GARLICHITHE (Vol. viii., p. 134.), who has confounded
Randle the _grandfather_ and Randle the _son_ of the writer of these
letters quoted by Mr. Hunter. Richard Minshull, who was the writer of
these letters in 1656, and died in the following year, had several sons,
of whom the eldest, Randle, correctly described by MR. HUGHES as the
great-great-grandson of the Minshull who first settled at Wistaston,
had seven children, of whom Elizabeth, the widow of Milton, was one.
She was baptized at Wistaston on the 30th Dec. 1638. In 1680 (about six
years after her husband's death), by means of a family arrangement with
Richard Minshull of Wistaston, frame-work knitter, who, there can be
little doubt, was her brother, evidenced by a bond in my possession, she
acquired a leasehold interest in a farm at Brindley, near Nantwich. On
the 20th July, 1720, by her name and description of Elizabeth Milton, of
Nantwich, widow, she administered to the effects of her brother, John
Minshull, in the Consistory Court of Chester; and her will, the probate
of which is also in my possession, is dated 22nd August, and proved 10th
October, 1727. MR. HUGHES having given a reference to the volume where
this information will be found in detail, a reference to it might have
saved GARLICHITHE the trouble of starting an objection, and shown him
that, so far from the facts stated being irreconcilable with Mr. Hunter's
tract, that gentleman's reference to Randle Holme's _Correspondence_
was suggested by a communication of my own to _The Athenæum_, and in
its turn furnished me with the clue from which I eventually ascertained
the particulars of Mrs. Milton's birth and parentage. I am sorry to say
that I have wholly failed in finding the register of her marriage: it is
not in the register-book of her native place. It might be worth while
to search the register of the parishes in which Milton's residence in
Jewin Street, and Dr. Paget's in Coleman Street, are situate. There is
no uncertainty as to the date, which Aubrey tells us was in "the yeare
before the sicknesse."

Though CRANMORE (Vol. v., p. 327.) is said to be a deserter from the
ranks of "N. & Q.," I hope he is known to some of your readers, and that
they will convey to him a hint that he is under something like a promise
to furnish information, which, as regards Dr. Paget's connexion with the
poet's widow, will still be welcome.

J. F. MARSH.

Despite his acknowledged infidelity, I must tender my thanks to
GARLICHITHE for his obliging reference to Mr. Hunter's tract; albeit
there is, I may be permitted to suggest, no position assumed in any note
upon Milton's widow which that tract in any way contravenes or sets
aside. The fact is, GARLICHITHE, in the outset, entirely misapprehends
the nature of my argument; and so leads himself, by a sort of literary
"Will-o-the-wisp," unconsciously astray.

It was not Randle the _grandfather_ of Richard Minshull, writer of the
two letters transcribed by Mr. Hunter, but Randle the eldest _son_ of
this Richard Minshull to whom I referred as the father of Elizabeth
Milton. Nor is it _possible_ that this Elizabeth could have "died in
infancy," seeing that I possess a copy of a bond (the original is also
extant) from her brother Richard, then of Wistaston, where he was
baptized April 7, 1641, secured to her as Elizabeth _Milton_, dated June
4, 1680.

As to the marriage itself, it may have taken place in London, where the
poet resided; or, which is more probable, at or near the residence of
their mutual friend, Dr. Paget. Milton was certainly not over-careful
about ritual observances, and it is not therefore unlikely that the rigid
Puritan preferred a private, or what is termed a civil marriage, to one
religiously and properly conducted in the church of his forefathers.

PECULIAR ORNAMENT IN CROSTHWAITE CHURCH.

(Vol. viii., p. 55.)

It is probable that these circles with eight radiations are the original
dedication-crosses of the church. Such crosses are still to be seen
painted on the piers of the nave in Roman Catholic churches. Durandus,
describing the consecration of a church, says:

    "In the meanwhile within the building twelve lamps be burning
    before twelve crosses, which be depicted on the walls of the
    church.... Lastly, he [the bishop] anointeth with chrism the
    twelve crosses {201} depicted on the wall."--Durandus _On
    Symbolism_, ed. Neale and Webb, p. 115.

In the Pontifical, _De Ecclesiæ Dedicatione_, the rubric directs,--

    "Item, depingantur in parietibus Ecclesiæ intrinsecùs per
    circuitum duodecim cruces, circa decem palmos super terram,
    videlicet tres pro quolibet, ex quatuor parietibus. Et ad
    caput cujuslibet crucis figatur unus clavus, cui affigatur una
    candela unius unciæ."

Dedication-crosses occur at Salisbury Cathedral, and at Uffington Church,
Berks, and in both cases on the exterior of the buildings.

The crosses at Salisbury are seven in number, viz. one over each
side-door at the west end, two on the buttresses of the north and south
transepts, two on the buttresses of the east end, and one in the centre
of the east wall. The number at Uffington is twelve, disposed as follows:
Three under the east window, three under the west window, one under the
south window of the south transept, one under the north window of the
north transept, one on the south wall of the nave, one on the north wall
of the nave, one on the south wall of the chancel, and one in the east
wall of the south transept. In each case the crosses have been of brass
inlaid in the wall, with the exception of one, which is of stone, and of
more elaborate design. The _rationale_ of dedication-crosses, according
to Durandus, is,--

    "First, as a terror to evil spirits, that they, having been
    driven forth thence, may be terrified when they see the sign
    of the cross, and may not presume to enter therein again.
    Secondly, as a mark of triumph; for crosses be the banners of
    CHRIST, and the signs of his triumph.... Thirdly, that such
    as look on them may call to mind the passion of CHRIST, by
    which he hath consecrated his Church, and their belief in his
    passion," &c.--Page 125.

Under these aspects the exterior would seem the more fitting, and may
have been the original position of them. Perhaps MR. ELLIOT will inform
us what is the number of crosses at Crosthwaite?

CURIOUS MISTRANSLATIONS.

(Vol. vi., p. 321.)

I have found, in _D'Israeli's Curiosities of Literature_, two or three
instances in which he mistranslates from the French. The first occurs in
the following passage in the article headed "Inquisition:"

    "Once all were Turks when they were not Romanists. Raymond,
    Count of Toulouse, was constrained to submit. _The inhabitants
    were passed on the edge of the sword_, without distinction of
    age or sex."

From the words which I have marked for Italics, it is clear that
D'Israeli translated the passage from some French author; but not being
aware of the idiomatic expression "passer au fil de l'épée," and that it
means "to put to the sword," he translated the words in their literal
sense, which in English is no sense at all.

The second example will be found in the article headed "Mysteries,
Moralities," &c. D'Israeli quotes some extracts from the _Mystery of St.
Dennis_, and concludes with the following on the subject of baptism:

    "Sire, oyez que fait ce fol prestre:
    Il prend de l'yaue _en_ une escuelle,
    Et gete aux gens sur le cervele,
    Et dit que _partants_ sont sauvés."

which he translates thus:

    "Sir, hear what this mad priest does:
    He takes water _out of_ a ladle,
    And, throwing it at people's heads,
    He says that _when they depart_ they are saved!"

The error of "out of" for "into" is unimportant; but not so where
he renders "partants" by "when they depart." The word "partant," in
the original, is an adverb, and means "thereupon," "forthwith." This
D'Israeli has mistaken for "partant," the participle of "partir:" and
hence the erroneous construction given to the passage.

A third sample occurs in the same article, where the author quotes from
one of the dramas called _Sotties_, a passage in which are these lines:

    "Tuer les gens pour leurs plaisirs,
    _Jouer le leur_, l'autrui saisir."

These he translates as follows:

    "Killing people for their pleasures,
    _Minding their own interests_, and seizing on what belongs to another."

Here we have "jouer le leur," to gamble, rendered by "to mind their
own interests;" a rather equivocal method, it must be confessed, of
accomplishing that object.

These are among the very few instances in which D'Israeli, by quoting
from the original authorities, enables us to form an opinion as to
the correctness of his anecdotes; and when we consider that by far
the greater proportion of these are drawn from French sources, there
is reason to apprehend that they may not have always been given with
sufficient fidelity. I am confirmed in this view by another quotation
which D'Israeli seems to have misunderstood. He is speaking of the feudal
custom of the French barons, according to which they were allowed to
cohabit with the new bride during the first three nights after marriage.
Upon this he remarks:

    "Montesquieu is infinitely French when he could turn this
    shameful species of tyranny into a bon mot; for he boldly
    observes on this: 'C'était bien ces trois nuits là qu'il
    fallait choisir; car pour les autres on {202} n'aurait pas
    donné beaucoup d'argent.' The legislator, in the wit, forgot
    the feelings of his heart."

I have never been able to conceive what meaning D'Israeli could have
attached to this quotation from Montesquieu, so as to torture it into a
_bon mot_. Not only is there nothing of the kind in the words he quotes,
but there is not even an attempt at it. The writer merely suggests a
reason for the preference given to the first three nights; and in doing
so he expresses the sentiments of the barons, and not his own. And yet,
it is upon this strange misapprehension of Montesquieu's meaning, that
D'Israeli lays at the door of that illustrious man the imputation of
being "infinitely French," and of forgetting, for the sake of a _bon
mot_, the feelings of his heart!

"TO SPEAK IN LUTESTRING."

(Vol. iii., p. 188.)

The Query on the meaning of the phrase "to speak in lutestring," used by
Philo-Junius, has remained so long without an answer, that to attempt to
give one now seems almost to require an apology. I will however do so. In
Letter XLVII., dated May 28, 1771, Philo-Junius says:

    "I was led to trouble you with these observations by a passage,
    which, _to speak in lutestring_, 'I met with this morning in
    the course of my reading,' and upon which I mean to put a
    question to the advocates for privilege."

Now we know, that if two lutes, or other stringed instruments, be placed
near each other, when a chord of one of them is struck, the corresponding
chord of the other will vibrate in unison, and give a similar note; one
lutestring will echo the other. The story of the maiden who believed
that the spirit of her dead lover was near her, because his harp sounded
responsive notes to hers, and who died heart-broken when she was
undeceived, is sufficiently well known. "To speak in lutestring" is then
to speak as another man's echo; and Philo-Junius here was the echo of the
Duke of Grafton, and used this affected phrase derisively, as being a
favourite, or at least well-known expression of his. In a letter which is
appended as a note to Letter XX., and which is dated six days previous to
the one just quoted, viz. May 22, 1771, he says:

    "But Junius has a great authority to support him, which, _to
    speak with the Duke of Grafton_, 'I accidentally met with this
    morning in the course of my reading.' It contains an admonition
    which cannot be repeated too often," &c.

I have not found the phrase "to speak in lutestring" anywhere else; but
I think, from a comparison of these two quotations, that it must mean
what I have supposed it to mean--to speak as the echo or exact repeater
of another man's words. Where can instances be found of the Duke of
Grafton's using this expression, which Philo-Junius ridicules?

BURIAL IN UNCONSECRATED PLACES.

(Vol. vi. _passim._)

So many interesting notices have been made by your correspondents on the
subject of peculiar interments,--skipping about from one part of the
country to another, and dropping down from the south into Lincolnshire,
as if in search of farther instances,--that I am induced to add to the
number of records, by stating the fact as to the late Mr. Dent, of
Winterton, whose body, at his particular request, was deposited after his
death in his own garden, on the south of the house in Winterton, where he
not only lived but died.

Friend Jonathan, as he was familiarly called, was a man of shrewd
understanding, and possessing strong common sense; yet, like others,
he had his failings, and amongst them the _amor nummi_ was not the
least obtrusive. As a very wealthy man he was looked up to by a little
aspiring community of Quakers in the neighbourhood; and his own dress,
when in a better suit, exhibited an appearance of his connexion with that
fraternity.

The Quakers had a small burial-ground at Thealby, in the parish of
Burton-upon-Stother, which I some years ago had the curiosity to inspect,
but such a forlorn lost place for such a sober and serious purpose I
never in my life before looked upon; it is posited at a little distance
from the public road entering Thealby from Winterton, where no doubt at
one time stood a lot of cottages and crofts, surrounded by common stone
walls, made from the flat stone of the neighbourhood. But so small and
so neglected was this burial place, that I could compare it to nothing
better than an old parish pinfold; it had been so little attended to
when I visited it, that the whole area was under a most luxuriant crop
of flourishing nettles, six or seven feet high. And as to graves, or the
purport of its occupation, we could see nothing; and yet its position was
such that with ordinary attention it might have been even a picturesque
spot, having three or four large trees overlooking it.

Upon an after inquiry I was told that a funeral had lately taken
place here, at which Friend Jonathan was the presiding attendant. But
in preparation for this ceremony they had found so much difficulty
in stubbing up the strong nettles, and digging the roots to form a
decent grave; and it was after all so difficult to find comfortable
standing-room about the grave, that I have ever {203} since concluded
that Mr. Dent must have been disgusted with it, as, upon depositing their
lost friend in the earth, he, as spokesman, thought it unnecessary to
make any observations, and he recommended that they should at once cover
the body up; and so it was done.

That Mr. Dent had any antipathy to the church I do not know, but that he
had a great dislike to paying unnecessary fees I have a good recollection
of. Before his death he requested that his body should be deposited in
his own garden; and his request was attended to by his nephew.

After the old gentleman's death, the present Mr. Dent, with a
praiseworthy attention, repaired and restored in the Elizabethan style
the old dilapidated dwelling-house and homestead where his uncle lived.
And I one day paid a visit to the grave, which is an unpretending ridge
on a well-mown grass-plat, and which, with the house and ground, appeared
to be properly attended to; and so, I presume, it continues to be.

WM. T. HESLEDEN.

J. H. M., in bringing forward Baskerville as an example of this unusual
occurrence, says, that "he directed he should be buried under a
_windmill_ near his garden." In a volume of Epitaphs, printed at Ipswich
in 1806, once the property of Archdeacon Nares, and containing several
MS. notes by him, Baskerville's is given, with a note by the editor, in
which he is stated to have been "inurned according to his own desire in a
_conical building_ near his late widow's house." The epitaph, written by
Baskerville himself, commences with these lines--

              "Stranger,
      Beneath this _cone_, in _unconsecrated_ ground,
    A friend to the liberties of mankind directed
          His body to be inurned."

The expression in each case, respecting the place of his interment, seems
scarcely strong enough for us to conclude it was a _windmill_. Perhaps J.
H. M. will kindly favour me with the authority for his statement. Nares
has made the following note on the epitaph at the bottom of the page:

    "I heard John Wilkes, after praising Baskerville, add, 'But he
    was a terrible infidel; he used to shock me!'"

PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.

    [At the suggestion of several correspondents we have reprinted
    from _The Athenæum_ of the 22nd Nov. 1851, the article
    detailing the new process by Mr. Muller referred to by the Rev.
    MR. SISSON in our last Number.]

_Mr. Muller's Process._--"The following photographic process has been
communicated to us by Mr. C. J. Muller, from Patna in the East Indies.
We have submitted it to an experienced photographer; and he informs us
that it offers many advantages over the Talbotype or the Catalissotype
of Dr. Woods, which it somewhat resembles; that it is easy in all its
manipulatory details, and certain in its results. We give Mr. Muller's
own words--

"'A solution of hydriodate of iron is made in the proportion of eight
or ten grains of iodide of iron to one ounce of water. This solution I
prepare in the ordinary way with iodine, iron-turnings, and water.--The
ordinary paper employed in photography is dressed on one side with a
solution of nitrate of lead (fifteen grains of the salt to an ounce
of water). When dry, this paper is iodized either by immersing it
completely in the solution of the hydriodate of iron, or by floating
the leaded surface on the solution. It is removed after the lapse of a
minute or two, and lightly dried with blotting-paper. This paper now
contains iodide of lead and protonitrate of iron. While still moist, it
is rendered sensitive by a solution of nitrate of silver (one hundred
grains to the ounce) and placed in the camera. After an exposure of the
duration generally required for Talbot's paper, it may be removed to a
dark room. If the image is not already out, it will be found speedily
to appear in great strength and with beautiful sharpness _without any
farther application_. The yellow tinge of the lights may be removed by a
little hyposulphite of soda, though simple washing in water seems to be
sufficient to fix the picture. The nitrate of lead nay be omitted; and
plain paper only, treated with the solution of the hydriodate of iron,
and acetic acid may be used with the nitrate of silver, which renders it
more sensitive. The lead, however, imparts a peculiar colorific effect.
The red tinge brought about by the lead may be changed to a black one by
the use of a dilute solution of sulphate of iron:--by which, indeed, the
latent image may be very quickly developed. The papers however will not
keep after being iodized.'

"Mr. Muller suggests, that as iodide of lead is completely soluble in
nitrate of silver, it might furnish a valuable photographic fluid, which
could be applied at any moment when required.

"No small degree of interest attaches to this process, originating in
experiments carried on in Central India. It appears perfectly applicable
to the albumenized glass and collodion processes."

_Detail on Negative Paper._--I have not observed before this, that any
photographic operator has "noted" the burnishing of the iodised paper
previous to adding the exciting solution, though I know it is usual to
burnish before taking a proof. This is a very useful adjunct to obtaining
minuteness, and it is a plan I have sometimes adopted. I at first thought
it would injure or knock off the iodized surface, but no injury whatever
arises from the rubbing. I use a small piece of glass rod, polished flat
at one end, so that it may present {204} a facet about half an inch
square; but I should imagine a better instrument might be manufactured
with a proper handle, and some mode of obtaining pressure; not obtaining
sufficient is the cause of a little after-disarrangement if the nitrate
of silver is laid on with a brush, but if floated the polish remains.

It cannot be doubted but paper is adequate to any detail; and when a
paper shall be manufactured of a perfect kind, there is no reason to
suppose but paper generally will rival collodion for most purposes.

Nothing prevents it at present but the uneven surface of paper. It is
very nearly perfect in the French negative paper; but that has so many
other drawbacks to its use that it cannot be safely depended upon. Our
manufacturers have still some improvements to make; for if Canson Frères
had left out the blackening chemical in the paper, it would have been
better than any of ours in my estimation.

WELD TAYLOR.

_Ammonio-nitrate of Silver._--Will any of your scientific correspondents
explain the chemical cause of my inability to form the ammonio-nitrate
of silver from a solution of nitrate of silver upon which albumenized
paper has been previously floated? Having excited some albumenized paper
on a forty-grain solution of nitrate of silver, I kept the solution
which had not been consumed for the purpose of converting it into
the ammonio-nitrate. But on dropping in the ammonia, not only did no
precipitate take place, but the ammoniacal smell which usually gives
place to the tarry odour remained. No albumen appeared to be dissolved
from the paper, and the solution had lost none of its silver, which
I subsequently collected by means of having formed a chloride. This
has occurred to me more than once, and I call attention to it, as the
investigation of it may lead to some new results.

years, more frequently under that of Weigel's _Book of German Arms_

princely counts; lords and persons of position, foregone and existing, in

_The Eye_ (Vol. viii., p. 25.).--I hope that interesting question raised

it, if it could be discovered when the phrase first came into use in our
language. Is it possible that the word "apple" is a corruption of the
Latin "pupilla?" or is it, according to H. C. K.'s suggestion, that the
iris, and not the pupil, is taken to represent an apple? Doubtless your
learned correspondent is aware that in Zech. ii. 12. the Hebrew phrase
is varied, the word‎ ‏בָּבָה‎‏ being used, and occurring only in this
passage. If Gesenius's derivation of this word be correct, which makes
it to signify "the gate of the eye," we have this idea put into a fresh
shape. Have not the Arabs a phrase, "He is dearer to me than the _pupil_
of mine eye," as well as the other one, "The man of the eye?" Curiously
enough, the Greeks express this idea by another word than κόρη, viz.
γλήνη (_i. e._ κόρης αὐγή, the splendour of the pupil (kin. αἴγλη), or
the pupil itself, οφθαλμου κόρη), in which the change of signification
is exactly the converse of what it is in κόρη; viz., 1st, pupil; 2nd, a
little girl; whence, as a term of reproach, ἔῤῥε κακὴ γλήνη.

_Canute's Point, Southampton_ (Vol. vii., p. 380.).--A correspondent
having noticed the inscription on the Canute Castle Inn, Southampton,
inquires for proof to authenticate the locality of the tradition referred
to. I submit the following extract from a local history:

    "Canute's Point was a projection of the shore near the mouth
    of the Itchen, where it is supposed the celebrated but
    much-embellished reproof to his courtiers was administered;
    and it was preserved by a line of piles driven into the beach,
    until the construction of the docks, which effaced the old
    beach line. Of Canute's Palace there are still a few remains,
    and the position fully justifies the presumption of its
    identity."

These piles were, I believe, in existence in the year 1836, when the act
for the construction of the docks was obtained.

    "An Historical Journal of the British Campaign on the

    Dedicated, by permission, to his Royal Highness Field Marshal
    the Duke of York. Printed for the Author. Birmingham, 1797."

The list of subscribers contains about a hundred names. There is a copy
of it in the British Museum. The one now before me is rendered more
valuable by copious marginal notes, evidently written by the author,
which are at the service of your correspondents. They furnish the
following extraordinary instance of personal bravery:

    "The same officer of this corps (3rd dragoon guards), who bore
    off the corpse of General Mansell, relates some particulars
    in the action of the 24th, under Gen. Otto:--that a man of
    the name of Barnes, who had been unfortunately reduced from a
    serjeant to the ranks, had bravely advanced, doing execution
    on the enemy, till his retreat was foreclosed, and he was seen
    engaged with five French dragoons at once; all of these he
    fairly cut down, when nine more came upon him, whom he faced
    and fairly kept at bay, till one of them got behind him, and
    shot the brave fellow in the head."

In reference to the action of the 26th, Captain Jones observes:

    "It is not possible to describe the bravery of the army on that
    day, nearly the whole of the British cavalry were engaged, and
    gained immortal honour."

The Duke of York's address to the army, published on the 28th of April,
thus concludes:

    "His Royal Highness has, at all times, had the highest
    confidence in the courage of the British troops in general, and
    he trusts that the cavalry will now be convinced that whenever
    they attack with the firmness, velocity, and order which they
    showed on this occasion, no number of the enemy (we have to
    deal with) can resist them."

_Curious Posthumous Occurrence_ (Vol. viii., p. 5.).--Though the worthy
grave-digger's account, reported by A. B. C., may be chargeable with
some exaggeration as to the _generality_ of body-turning, and though
the decomposing reason assigned may not be true, yet, that many dead
human bodies are found with their faces downwards, is nevertheless quite
correct.

Works are now in progress, at the east end of this metropolis, under
my own immediate observation, where this fact has been incontestably
verified. How long since, or on what occasion, these remains of mortality
were placed there, I know not; but, in the course of excavation required
for the foundations, they are frequently met with, and, in many
instances, in this strange position.

I had come to the conclusion, that, during some raging pestilence (and
which may indeed again occur, unless an acceleration takes place in our
wounded-snake-like motion in the way of sanitary improvement), I say, it
had been my impression, that during some such awful calamity, the anxiety
of the uncontaminated to avoid infection had induced them to remove their
less fortunate fellow-creatures out of the way with so much haste as
actually to bury them alive! and in some convulsive struggle between life
and death, they had turned themselves over!

remembers a case where, after interment, in process of time the occiput
takes the place of the facial bones; but, he says, very frequently the
head drops either on one side or the other--a circumstance which any one
conversant with the human skeleton and the connexion of the cranium with
the vertebræ would deem most natural.

_Books chained to Desks in Churches_ (Vol. viii. p. 94.).--An engraving
of a very fine perpendicular lettern, having a book fastened to it by
a chain, is given in the _Proceedings of the Arch. Inst._ for 1846, as
existing at that time in the church of St. Crux, York. In 1851 I noticed
the upper part of one in Chesterton Church near Cambridge, placed on the
sill of the east window of the south aisle with a book lying upon it,
very much torn and wanting the title-page. I ascertained the subject of
it at the time; but omitted to make a note of it, and I am sorry to say
it has now slipped my memory.

Rutter, in his _Somersetshire_, speaks of some old reading desks, which
were still remaining in 1829 in Wrington Church, fastened to the walls of
the chancel, on which were several books, "especially Fox's _Martyrs_,
and the _Clavis Bibliorum_ of F. Roberts, who was rector of the parish
in 1675." There was one also about the same time at Chew Magna Church,
Somersetshire; with a copy of Bishop Jewel's _Defence of the Church_
chained to it. In Redcliff Church, Bristol, there is a small mahogany
one supported by a bracket, with a brass chain attached, near the vestry
on the north side of the choir. Until within a very few years, a desk,
with Fox's _Martyrs_ lying upon it, was in the Holy Trinity Church, Hull,
affixed to one of the pillars in the nave.

A fine old Bible and chain is shown amongst the relics at Trinity Church,
Stratford-upon-Avon.

It would appear that theological works were not the only ones secured
in this manner; for I find (Rutter's _Somersetshire_, p. 258.) that one
Captain S. Sturmy of Easton in Gordano published a folio, entitled _The
Mariner's or Artisan's Magazine_, a copy of which he gave to the parish
to be chained and locked in the desk, until any ingenious person should
borrow it, leaving 3_l._ as a security in the hands of the trustees
against damage, &c.

It is somewhat strange that I should have omitted the following passage
whilst writing on this subject in a recent Number, as the work to which
it refers, Bishop Jewel's _Defence of his Apology for the Church of
England_, is so well known:

    "At the desire of Archbishop Parker, a copy of the _Defence_
    was set up soon after Jewel's death, in almost every parish
    church in England; and fragments of it are still to be seen in
    some churches, together with the chain by which it was attached
    to the reading-desk provided for it."

This extract is taken from the _Life of Bishop Jewel_, prefixed to the
English translation of the _Apology_, edited by Dr. Jelf for the Society
for promoting Christian Knowledge (8vo. Lond. 1849), p. xx.

An order for the setting up of "the _Paraphrases_ of Erasmus in English
upon the gospels" in some convenient place within all churches and
chapels in the province of York, will be found in Archbishop Grindal's
_Injunctions for the Laity_, § 4. (_Remains, &c._, Parker Society, p.

In Malvern Abbey Church is a stand to which two books are chained. The
one is a commentary on the Book of Common Prayer; the other is a treatise
on Church Unity. In Kinver Church (Worcestershire) are three books placed
in a desk (_not_ chained) in the south aisle: being _The Whole Duty of
Man_ (1703); _A Sermon made in Latine in the Reigne of Edward the Sixte_,
by John Jevvel, Bishop of Sarisburie; and _The Actes and Monumentes of
Christian Martyrs_ (1583).

_Quarrel_ (Vol. vi., p. 172.).--BALLIOLENSIS will be pleased with Mr.
Trench's ingenious account of our conversion of a _complaint_ into a
_quarrel_.

    "The Latin word (_querela_) means properly 'complaint,' and we
    have in 'querulous' this its proper meaning coming distinctly
    out. Not so, however, in 'quarrel,' for Englishmen, being wont
    not merely to 'complain,' but to set vigorously about righting
    and redressing themselves, their griefs being also grievances,
    out of this word, which might have given them only {207}
    'querulous' and 'querulousness,' have gotten 'quarrel' as
    well."--_On the Study of Words_, p. 57.

    "We might safely conclude," Mr. Trench premises, "that a nation
    would not be likely tamely to submit to tyranny and wrong,
    which made 'quarrel' out of 'querela.'"

This, I say, is very ingenious, but did _this_ nation make _quarrel_ out
of _querela_? Did they not take it ready made from their neighbours,
the French, Italian, Spanish, who have all performed, and, I presume,
led the way in performing, the same exploit; showing that they must all
have had the same disposition inhering in them to set about righting and
redressing themselves, though not always, perhaps, with so prompt and
active a vigour as that ascribed to the English by Mr. Trench.

_Burial on the North Side of Churches_ (Vol. vi., p. 112. &c.).--The
opinion of your correspondent SELEUCUS, that the avoidance of burial on
the north side of a churchyard is to be attributed to its being generally
the unfrequented side of the church, is borne out by the fact, that in
the rare cases where the entrance to the church is _only_ on the north
side, the graves are also to be found there in preference to being on
the south, which in such a case would of course be "the back of the
church." SELEUCUS mentions one instance of a church entered only from the
north. To this example may be added the little village church of Martin
Hussingtree, between Worcester and Droitwich, where the sole entrance is
on the north, and where _all_ the burials are on the same side of the
church.

_Stone Pillar Worship_ (Vol. vii., p. 383.).--The Rowley Hills near
Dudley, twelve in number, and each bearing a distinctive name, make up
what may be called a mountain of basaltic rock, which extends for several
miles in the direction of Hales Owen. From the face of a precipitous
termination of the southern extremity of these hills rises a pillar of
rock, known as the "The Hail Stone." I conjecture that the word _hail_
may be a corruption of the archaic word _haly_, holy; and that this
pillar of rock may have been the object of religious worship in ancient
times. The name may have been derived directly front the Anglo-Saxon
_Haleg stan_, holy stone. It is about three quarters of a mile distant
from an ancient highway called "The Portway," which is supposed to be of
British origin, and to have led to the salt springs at Droitwich. I have
no knowledge of any other place bearing the name of Hail Stone, except
a farm in the parish of West Fetton in Shropshire, which is called "The
Hail Stones." No stone pillars are now to be found upon it: there is a
quarry in it which shows that the sand rock lies there very near the
surface. Dr. Plot, in his _History of Staffordshire_ (p. 170.), describes
the rock on the Rowley Hills as being "as big and as high on one side
as many church steeples are." He relates that he visited the spot in
the year 1680, accompanied by a land-surveyor, who, ten years before
that time, had noticed that at this place the needle of the compass was
turned six degrees from its due position. The influence which the iron in
basaltic rocks has on the needle was not known at that period, and the
Doctor makes two conjectures in explanation of the phenomenon observed.
First, he says, "there must be in these lands that miracle of Nature
we call a loadstone;" and he adds, "unless it come to pass by some old
armour buried hereabout in the late civil war." The sonorous property of
the rock led him to conjecture "that there might be here a vault in which
some great person of ancient times might be buried under this natural
monument; but digging down by it as near as I could where the sound
directed, I could find no such matter."

Plot does not mention the name by which this rock was known. It is not
mentioned at all by either Erdeswick, Shaw, or Pitt, in their Histories
of Staffordshire.

_Bad_ (Vol. vi. p. 509.).--Horne Tooke's etymology may, perhaps, satisfy
B. H. COWPER'S inquiry, or at least gratify his curiosity. He assumes
the _bay_ or bark of a dog to be excited by what it _abhors_, _hates_,
_defies_; and farther, that our epithet of _bad_ is applied by us to
that, which, for reasons which we may call moral (_æsthetic_, I believe
{208} I ought to say) reasons or feelings, we _hate_, or _abhor_. And he
forms it thus, _bay-ed_, bay'd, ba'd, _bad_.

_Porc-pisee_ (Vol. vi., p. 579.).--MR. WARDE will find that this is
the old English way of writing _porpoise_, more nearly to the French
and Italian. Spenser writes _porcpisces_, and Ray _porpesse_, i.e.
_porc-pesee_. Both are quoted in Richardson.

"_Wheal_ instead of milk," is _whey_ or _whig_. "To _flesh_ in sin," is
to indulge in, to accustom to, to inure to, the gratification of the
sinful lusts of the _flesh_. Johnson has from Hales the same expression
"fleshed in sin" which he interprets "hardened."

_Lowbell_ (Vol. vii., pp. 181. 272.).--Your correspondents H. T. W. and
M. H. will find sufficient reasons from Nares' quotations to convince

(in Johnson) that the verb, to _lowbell_, was used consequentially to
signify to frighten into a snare, and thus, to ensnare. And the noun, a
snare, allurement, temptation.

    "Now commonly he who desires to be a minister looks not at the
    work, but at the wages; and by that _lure_ or _lowbell_ may
    be toll'd from parish to parish all the town over."--Milton,

_Praying to the West_ (Vol. viii., p. 102.).--_The isles of the West_, by
which is understood what we term the British Isles, in the ancient Hindoo
writings are described as _the Sacred Isles_, or the abode of religion.
The Celtic tribes used the practice of turning to the West in their
religious rites, having adopted it in a very early age from a reason
similar to that which led the _Turks_ in a later age to turn towards
Mecca, and _other nations_ towards the East; that is, the superior
sanctity attached by each to these several points. This practice the
Celtic tribes brought with them in their migration from the East to those
parts in which we now find it in the West; where it has been retained by
their descendants after the circumstances which gave rise to it had been
long forgotten.

of the first volume: "Gibbon's copy, bought at the sale of his library
at Lausanne, Sept. 1833.--JOHN WORDSWORTH." You will find a reference
to this gentleman, "N. & Q.," Vol. v., p. 604. About four hundred of
Gibbon's books were in the library of the late Rev. Samuel Farmar Jarvis,
of Connecticut, who bought them at Lausanne. Among them was Casiri,
_Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispania_. Some of these books had his name, E.
GIBBON, printed in them in Roman letters; others had his coat of arms.
Dr. Jarvis's library was sold by Lyman and Rawdon in New York on the

Herrera's _America_, in English, 6 vols. 8vo.

West, mentioned by {209} your correspondent H. G. D. I have never heard
of but _one_ portrait by West of Dr. Franklin, and that was painted for
my grandfather, Mr. Edward Duffield, one of the executors of the Doctor's

in excellent preservation. A short notice of it will be found in the

_Derivation of "Island"_ (Vol. viii., p. 49.).--H. C. K.'s derivation
of _island_ from _eye_, the visual orb, because each are surrounded by
water, seems to me so like a banter on etymologists, that I am doubtful
whether I ought to notice it; but as our Editor seems, by the space he
has given it, to take it as serious, I shall venture to say two or three
words upon it. H. C. K. begins by begging the question: he says that "the
etymon from the Fr. _isle_, It. _isola_, Lat. _insula_, is _manifestly
erroneous_." Now I think I can prove--and that by a single word--that
it is "manifestly" the true one. I only reverse his order of placing
these words; they should stand, the mother first, the children after;
_insula_ Lat., _isola_ It., _isle_ Fr., and to them I add my _single
word_, which H. C. K. has chosen to ignore altogether, _isle_ English;
as, _Isle_ of Wight, _Isle_ of Man, _Isle_ of Thanet, _Isles_ of Arran,
&c. This single word, thus supplied, is to my mind a sufficient answer
to H. C. K.'s theory, but I may add, as a corroboration, the peculiarity
of retaining in _spelling_, and dropping in _pronunciation_, the _s_ in
the English _isle_ and _island_, just as it is in the French _isle_ and
_islot_. Indeed the relation between the French and English words is,
in this case, not _derivation_ but _identity_. I may also observe that
the Scotch and Irish names for an island, _inch_, _innis_, _ennis_--as,
_Inch_-keith, _Innis_-fallen, _Ennis_-killen--are "manifestly" derived
from _insula_, the common parent of all. I half suspect that H. C. K. is
a wag, and meant to try whether we should take seriously what he meant as
_all my eye_!

restoration of the church, about eight years ago, by the present rector,
the Rev. D. Melville, who carefully preserved the hour-glass relic. In
order to show how much had been done for the church, I drew interior
and exterior views of the old building, with its great dilapidations
and unusually monstrous disfigurements, which drawings were hung in
the vestry, at the suggestion of the rector, as parish memorials; a
proceeding which I think might be copied with advantage in all cases of
church restoration. In the one drawing mentioned the hour-glass stand is
a conspicuous object.

CUTHBERT BEDE, B.A.

The following extract is from a tract published by the Cambridge Camden
Society, entitled _A few hints on the Practical Study of Ecclesiastical
Antiquities_:

    "_Hour-glass Stand._ A relick of Puritanick times. They are
    not very uncommon; they generally stand on the right-hand of
    the pulpit, and are made of iron. Examples Coton, Shepreth. A
    curious revolving one occurs at Stoke D'Abernon, Surrey, and in
    St. John Baptist, Bristol, where the hour-glass itself remains.
    Though a Puritanick innovation, it long kept its place: for Gay
    in his _Pastorals_ writes:

    'He said that Heaven would take her soul no doubt,
    And spoke the _hour-glass_ in her praise quite out:'

    and it is depicted by the side of a pulpit in one of Hogarth's
    paintings."

I saw, a few weeks ago, an iron hour-glass stand affixed to the pulpit in
Odell Church, Beds.

_Selling a Wife_ (Vol. vii., pp. 429. 602.).--There can be no question
that this offence is an indictable misdemeanor. I made, at the time, a
memorandum of the following case:

    "West Riding Yorkshire Sessions, June 28, 1837. Joshua Jackson,
    convicted of selling his wife, imprisoned for one month with
    hard labour."

_Impossibilities of History_ (Vol. viii., p. 72.).--St. Bernard,
according to Gibbon, lived from 1091 to 1153. Henry I., who did rebel
against his father, was twelve years older than the Saint, and ascended
the throne at the age of twenty-one in the year 1100, when the Saint
was nine years old. The descent from the devil alludes, I should think,
to Robert le Diable, the father of the Conqueror. The historian of _The
Tablet_ found the authority most probably in some theatrical review or
fly-leaf of the libretto.

_Lad and Lass_ (Vol. vii., p. 56.).--_Lass_, Hickes (quoted by Lye in
Junius) says, was originally written, and is a corruption of _laddess_;
thus, we may suppose _laddess_, _ladse_, _lass_: and _lad_ may correlate
with the Gr. ἀγωγὸς, a leader, so familiar to us in the sneered at
pæd-_agogue_, _i. e._ the boy-_leader_. The _lad_, from the Anglo-Saxon
_lædian_, to lead (says Junius), is the _leăd_--"One who, on account of
his tender years, is under a _leader_, a guide, a director."

We apply the common expression "He is yet in _leading_ strings" to him
who has not strength or courage to go alone, to act independently for
himself.

_Enough_ (Vol. vii., p. 455.).--Enough was not, and is not always, nor
was it originally, pronounced _enuf_. The old way of writing was "ynou,
inouh, ynowgh;" and in Gower, _enough_ is made to rhyme with _slough_,
i. e. _slow_ or _slew_, the past tense of _slay_. MR. WRIGHT will find
this to be so by looking into Richardson's quotations. The word, he will
see also, was from very early times written, as still not unfrequently
pronounced, _enew_ or _enow_.

_he had found the Latin lines which formed the subject of his Query. They
shall appear as soon as he has given us such reference._

C. M. I. _will see that his wish has been complied with. The others we
hope soon. We have not inserted his Note respecting a certain learned
Professor, who, we think we can assure_ C. M. I., _does not belong to the
sect which he mentions._

opportunity._

Porny's_ Heraldry, _which may be picked up for a few shillings, would
probably furnish what our Correspondent desires._

J. C. E., _who writes respecting Milton's_ Lycidas, _is requested to
favour us with a full communication on the subject._

    "This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,

    cases, all kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in
    confined habit of body, as also diarrhœa, bowel complaints,
    affections of the kidneys and bladder, such as stone or gravel;
    inflammatory irritation and cramp of the urethra, cramp of
    the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and hemorrhoids. This
    really invaluable remedy is employed with the most satisfactory
    result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints, where
    irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary
    and bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually
    the troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth
    to express the conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica
    is adapted to the cure of incipient hectic complaints and

SOME ACCOUNT of DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE in ENGLAND, from the Conquest
to the end of the thirteenth Century, with numerous Illustrations of
Existing Remains from Original Drawings. By T. HUDSON TURNER.

"What Horace Walpole attempted, and what Sir Charles Lock Eastlake has
done for oil-painting--elucidated its history and traced its progress
in England by means of the records of expenses and mandates of the
successive Sovereigns of the realm--Mr. Hudson Turner has now achieved
for Domestic Architecture in this country during the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries."--_Architect._

"The writer of the present volume ranks among the most intelligent of the
craft, and a careful perusal of its contents will convince the reader
of the enormous amount of labour bestowed on its minutest details,
as well as the discriminating judgment presiding over the general
arrangement."--_Morning Chronicle._

"The book of which the title is given above is one of the very few
attempts that have been made in this country to treat this interesting
subject in anything more than a superficial manner.

"Mr. Turner exhibits much learning and research, and he has consequently
laid before the reader much interesting information. It is a book that
was wanted, and that affords us some relief from the mass of works on
Ecclesiastical Architecture with which of late years we have been deluged.

"The work is well illustrated throughout with wood-engravings of the
more interesting remains, and will prove a valuable addition to the
antiquary's library."--_Literary Gazette._

"It is as a text-book on the social comforts and condition of the Squires
and Gentry of England during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that
the leading value of Mr. Turner's present publication will be found to
consist.

"Turner's handsomely-printed volume is profusely illustrated with careful
woodcuts of all important existing remains, made from drawings by Mr.
Blore and Mr. Twopeny."--_Athenæum._

THE DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE OF THE MIDDLE AGES. Vol. II.--THE FOURTEENTH
CENTURY. By the Editor of "The Glossary of Architecture."

This volume is issued on the plan adopted by the late Mr. Hudson Turner
in the previous volume: viz., collecting matter relating to Domestic
buildings of the Period, from contemporary records, and applying the
information so acquired to the existing remains.

Not only does the volume contain much curious information both as to the
buildings and manners and customs of the time, but it is also hoped that

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
